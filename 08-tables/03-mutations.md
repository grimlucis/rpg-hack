## Mutations

A d500 on either of these tables, and you'll be gross in no time!

Note: to throw a d500, throw a d100 for the tens and units, and a d5 (or d6
reroll 6) for the hundreds. A 5 is a 0, unless both the tens and units are 0, in
which case it's a 500.

E.g. 1d5 = 5, 1d10 = 0, 1d% = 80; the result is 80.
