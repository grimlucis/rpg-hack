## Camp followers

These hapless, mostly useless souls follow adventurers around performing menial
tasks and hoping for scraps of treasure. Upkeep is 5cp per day (35 cp per week,
15 sp per month). If you can't or won't pay them, some might leave, some might
starve, and some might steal your purse and run into the forest. Camp followers
will scavenge constantly and pick over the remains of any nearby battle, siege,
or burned village. They will perform menial tasks for you: washing clothes,
airing fabrics, clearing campsites, setting fires, washing pots and pans,
preparing basic meals, removing lice, cutting hair, watering horses, fetching
water, and all the other day-to-day tasks too dull to include in an RPG.
