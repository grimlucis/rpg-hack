## Tools of the trade

### Dice

The GLOG uses standard dice notation:

	ndy[+/-x]

Where `n` is the number of dice, `y` is the number of sides of the dice, and the
optional `+/-x` is the number `x` to either add or subtract to the sum of the
dice, and `d` is a literal 'd' to separate `n` and `y`.

For example, if the book calls for a roll of 3d6+4, roll 3 six-sided dice, add
the face values together, and add 4, e.g.

	Rolled 4, 3, 6
	4 + 3 + 6 = 13
	13 + 4 = 17
	Final result is 17

While the GLOG can be played with only regular 6-sided dice (see the appendix),
players should at least have a d6 and d20; a polydice set is preferred, and a
polydice set supplemented with a collection of Zocchi dice is even
better. Polydice can be found at local game shops, comic book stores, and
online. Zocchi dice are usually only found online, but some speciality
role-playing game shops may carry them (the author found d30s for sale when
visiting the MOA in Minnesota).

The polydice are:

- The four-sided die (d4), a tetrahedron
- The six-sided die (d6), a cube
- The eight-sided die (d8), an octahedron
- The ten-sided die, numbered either 0-9 (d10) or 00-90 (d%), a pentagonal
  trapezohedron
- The twelve-sided die (d12), a dodecahedron
- The twenty-sided die (d20), an icosahedron

When a d10 roll is asked for, a 0 on the face is taken to be a 10.

A d100 is usually simulated either by:

1. Rolling a d% for the tens digit and a d10 for the units digit, taking 00 to
   be 100.
2. Rolling d10s of two different colors for the tens and units digit, e.g. a red
   for the tens and a blue for the units.

Rarely is a literal d100 rolled, for practical reasons.

The Zocchi dice are:

- The three-sided die (d3), a three flat-sided prolate spheroid (American/Aussie
  football or rugby ball)
- The five-sided die (d5), a triangular prism
- The seven-sided die (d7), a pentagonal prism
- The fourteen-sided die (d14), a heptagonal trapezohedron
- The sixteen-sided die (d16), an octagonal trapezohedron
- The twenty-four-sided die (d24), a tetrakis hexahedron
- The thirty-sided die (d30), a triantakohedron
- The one-hundred-sided die (d100), colloquially known as the "zocchihedron"

Alternatives to the Zocchi dice, and even to regular polydice, are given in the
appendix.

The book may also call for d66 or even d666; these are not sixty-six or
six-hundred and sixty-six sided dice, but rather d6s for each digit, as if a
base 7 number.

### Character sheet

The details of a player character are compiled to a character sheet. An example
is provided in the appendices, but it can be fun to instead just write character
details to ruled, dotted, or blank paper. You should track:

- The character's name, race, pronouns, and optionally who plays them
- The character's ability scores
- The character's Attack, Defense, Stealth, Save, Encumbrance, and class
  details such as Magic Dice
- The character's level, experience points, and cash on hand
- The character's class templates
- Any treasure or equipment the character is carrying

The GM may optionally keep character sheets or stat blocks for important NPCs,
hirelings, etc.
