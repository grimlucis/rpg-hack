## Arcane Magic

### Lock

R: 50' T: [dice] creatures or objects D: 10 minutes

Non-living object closes and becomes locked. If the object is a door, chest, or
similar object, it will slam shut, dealing [sum] damage to any creature passing
through it and then trapping them. This spell works on things that aren't
technically portals (for example, a sword could be locked in its
scabbard). Requires Str 10 + [dice]x4 to open. Alternatively, this spell can be
cast on a creature's orifice. The creature gets a Save to resist, and another
Save at the end of each of its turns.

### Knock

R: 50' T: [dice] objects D: 0

Object is opened. Doors are flung wide, locks are broken, shackles are bent
open, belts come undone. Treat this as a Strength check made with Str 10 +
[dice]x4. If target is an armoured creature, Save or armour falls off. If target
is an unarmoured creature, Save or vomit for 1d4 rounds.

### Grease

R: 50' T: object, surface D: [dice]x2 rounds

Can be cast directly on a creature or [sum]10' x 10' surfaces. Creatures moving across the area must Save vs Dexterity or drop held objects, or, if moving, drop prone.

### Force Field

R: 10' T: plane or sphere D: concentration

Creates a shimmering force field, 10‘x10’, centered up to 10'
away. Alternatively, create a sphere centered on the caster 5' in diameter
(large enough for the caster and +1 person). The force field has [sum] HP. All
attacks against it hit.

### Levitate

R: 50' T: creature object D: concentration

You will an object to raise, lower, or hover. You cannot move the object
horizontally, and you cannot move it more than 10' per turn. Maximum weight is
[dice]x500 lbs. Lasts as long as you concentrate, but you take 1d6 psychic
damage per round after [dice]x3 rounds.

### Magic Missile

R: 200' T: creature D: 0

Target takes [sum] + [dice] damage, no Save.

### Feather Fall

R: 10’ T: [dice] creatures or objects D: 0

If you would take fall damage, you can cast this spell as a reaction to negate
it. You float gently to the ground (possibly alarmingly late).

### Sleep

R: 50' T: creature D: 10 min

Target falls into a magical slumber, and can't be awoken by anything less
vigorous than a slap (a standard action). Non-alert, unaware targets are not
allowed a Save. Can affect creatures up to [sum] HD. If [sum] is at least 4
times the creature's HD, the duration becomes permanent (until slapped) and the
creature no longer needs to eat or drink while sleeping. If you also invested 3
[dice] or more into this spell, the duration becomes permanent, and you can set
the only condition that will cause the creature to awake (the sunrise before the
apocalypse, true love’s kiss, etc.)

### Light
R: touch T: object or creature D: [dice]x2 hours

Object illuminates as a torch, with a radius of 20’+[dice]x10’. Alternatively,
you can make an Attack roll against a sighted creature. If you succeed, the
creature is blinded for [sum] rounds. If [sum] is greater than 12, the creature
is permanently blinded. You can chose the colour of the light. If you invest 4
[dice] or more this light has all the qualities of natural
sunlight. Alternatively, if you invest 4 [dice] or more the light can be purest
octarine, although it will only last for 1 round. Octarine light is extremely
dangerous.

### Wizard Vision

R: touch T: sighted creature D: 10 min / permanent

If you invest one [die]: Target can see invisible things. Target can see through
illusions. Non-magical disguises are not penetrated.

If you invest two or more [dice]: This can only be cast on yourself. As above,
except you can also see through magical darkness, and see the true forms of
shapeshifters. There are also some permanent effects: (a) You can forever see
invisible things as a slight warping or lensing of light. You know “there's
something over there” and what size it roughly is, but nothing else. (b) You can
tell if someone else is a spellcaster by looking them in the eyes.

The price for this gift is your mind. You suffer a permanent loss of 1d6
Willpower (as you reject the true nature of Creation and go slightly mad) or 1d6
Charisma (as you accept the true nature of Creation and alienate yourself from
your peers).

### Prismatic Ray

R: 200' T: [dice] creatures or objects D: 0

Target suffers a different effect depending on which color strikes the
target. Roll a d10:

1. Red. Target takes [sum] fire damage, Save for half.
2. Orange. Target takes [sum] bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. Save
   negates.
3. Yellow. Target takes [sum] lightning damage, save for half.
4. Green. Target takes [sum] acid damage, save for half.
5. Blue. Target takes [sum] ice damage, save for half.
6. Purple. Target takes [sum] necrotic damage and is blinded for [sum]
   rounds. Save negates.
7. Struck twice. Roll a d6 twice. Add effects; make one save.
8. As 7.
9. As 9.
10. Struck thrice. Roll a d6 three times.

### Fireball

R: 200' T: 20' diameter D: 0

Does [sum] fire damage to all objects.

### Raise Spirit

R: touch T: spirit D: [sum] minutes

After a ritual that takes 10 minutes, you call out to the spirit of a dead
person. The spirit can be anyone, from long-dead kings to newly-murdered party
members. You do not need the creature's body. This spell can only be cast
between sunset and dawn. Roll 1d6 on the table below, modified by the following:

#### Bonuses

* +1 for each [die] invested in this spell
* +1 if the spirit died within a week
* +1 if the spirit has unfinished business in Creation
* +1 if you know the spirit's true name
* +4 if you personally knew the creature before it died

#### Penalties

* -1 for each of the creature's original HD
* -1 if the spirit was a wizard
* -1 if the spirit is angry or irritated with you
* -2 if you have only a vague name or description
* -4 if the spirit was a necromancer or had significant magical powers in life

Other bonuses and penalties at the GM's discretion. The stronger the soul, the
more dangerous the summon.

#### Raise Spirit Result

   Roll   | Result
----------|-------------
0 or less | The spirit is raised, but lashes out in anger and annoyance. You take 2d6 damage. If this damage reduces you to zero HP, you are dragged straight to the afterlife (no Save). Alternatively, the spirit casts Fatal Doom (see below) on you.
1         | The spirit is raised, but it cannot be put down. If there is a corpse nearby the spirit will possess it. Otherwise, it will act as a disembodied undead of appropriate HD.
2         | The wrong spirit is raised. It may be more or less useful than the intended spirit.
3         | The spirit is raised, but its answers are mocking and cruel.
4         | The spirit is raised and answers your questions truthfully.
5         | The spirit is raised and also provides a useful answer to a question you did not ask.
6         | The spirit is raised and remains for 1d6 additional minutes.
7 or higher | The spirit is raised, and can be given one command (as per the Command Undead spell below.)

### Explode Corpse

R: 50' T: corpse D: 0

Target corpse explodes, dealing damage in a [dice]x5' radius, Save vs Dexterity
for half. The maximum damage dealt is dependent on the creature's size:

Creature | Damage
---------|-------
Rat      | 1
Dog      | 1d6
Human    | 2d6
Cow      | 3d6
Elephant | 6d6
Whale    | 8d6

This spell cannot target undead creatures unless you control them.

### Death Mask

R: touch T: humanoid corpse D: varies

You touch a corpse and the face peels off like a mask. The rest of the corpse
shrivels up and flakes into dust. When you (and only you) wear the mask, you
will look and sound like the person whose face you're wearing, but only to
sentient people (no effect on animals, spirits, or elementals). The mask will
rot into uselessness after [sum] days. If [dice] is at least 4, the mask is
permanent.

### Fear

R: 50' T: creatures up to [sum] HD D: 0

Target creatures must Save vs Fear or take a morale check, or flee from you. If
you cast this spell with 4 [dice], creatures unused to supernatural occurrences
(peasants, domesticated dogs, etc.) must also Save or age 2d10 years.

### Rot

R: touch T: creature or object D: 0

Creatures take 2x[dice] damage, Save for half. Creatures also age 2d10 years (no
mechanical effect), and may develop grey hair, shakes, and wrinkles. Objects are
aged according to how many [dice] are invested. Books sprout into mold, wood
becomes soggy, lamps run out of fuel and grow cold, and stone is entirely
unaffected. 1 [die]: [sum] days. 2 [dice]: [sum] months. 3 [dice] or more: [sum]
years. Undead are healed for [sum]+[dice] HP, or 1 permanent HP is restored (to
the former maximum).

### Raise Undead

R: 20' T: [dice]x2 HD corpse D: 2 hours

Target is raised as a specific type of undead that is obedient to the
caster. The creature is animated by a specially developed spell or an obedient
ghost. When the spell’s duration ends, the undead may collapse, and cannot be
raised again or used for any further spells.

The type of undead raised depends on the target and the [dice] invested.

  Dice   | Scale of creature | Example
---------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------
1 [die]  | 1-2 HD creature   | corpse snake, crawling claw, skeleton, zombie
2 [dice] | 1-4 HD creature   | wight
3 [dice] | 1-6 HD creature   | war spirit, mummy
4 [dice] | 1-8 HD creature   | something impressively terrifying

Undead typically have reduced stats compared to their living form. Undead of 5
HD or less are nearly mindless. If you die while undead are under your control,
the spell's duration expires, or you try to end the spell, there is a [HD]-in-10
chance the undead remains active. Otherwise, it collapses.

Instead of letting the spell expire, you can keep the [dice] you spent on the
spell invested. The spell's duration becomes permanent as long as those [dice]
remain invested. Alternatively, if you spend 4 [dice] to raise a 1 or 2 HD
creature, the spell's duration becomes permanent and no [dice] need to be
invested. Creatures may retain some special abilities they had in life.

### Innocent Revenant

R: Touch T: corpse D: 0

A creature of [dice] HD or less that died in the last 3 turns immediately
returns as an undead version of itself with full HP. The HD requirement is
ignored if the target is well known to you (a fellow PC, for example). This
revenant can never gain HP, and loses 1 HP, and 1 point of TAL and WIL to a
minimum of 5, every hour until it reaches 0 HP and disintegrates. This HP loss
can be healed by the Rot spell or other effects that heal undead creatures. The
revenant is unaware that it ever died, even ignoring obvious signs of death (no
heartbeat, cold flesh, gaping wounds). However, if someone else insists on
confronting them with evidence of their own death, they fly into a rage,
becoming a mindless undead.

### Command Undead

R: 50' T: person D: [dice] hours

Target: 1 undead creature that can hear and understand you.

You shout a single-word command to your target, who must Save or obey. If the
command lasts more than a single round, intelligent undead, or undead under the
control of another necromancer, get a new Save at the beginning of each of their
rounds. You can spend additional [dice] to increase the effects.

- Affect +2 targets.
- You may increase then length of your command by +2 words.
- You may increase the duration between checks by +2 rounds.

### Fog

R: 30’ T: self D: [dice] hours

You breath out a bunch of fog, filing an area [dice]x20' in radius. No one can
see beyond 10' in the fog. Undead can see through the fog. If you invest 4
[dice], you can instead breath out a layer of thick grey-yellow clouds that
block sunlight for the spell's duration, for 3 miles in every direction.

### Death Scythe

R: touch T: corpse D: [dice]x10 min

The corpse disintegrates as you pluck a black scythe from its chest. The scythe
deals 1d8+[STR bonus] damage. It deals double damage to creatures of the same
type as the corpse used to create the scythe (so a scythe drawn from a troll's
body would deal double damage to trolls).

### Finger of Death

R: 50' T: creature D: 0

Target living creature must Save or die. Creatures with a significant magical
nature gain a bonus equal to their HD. Frail mortal creatures may not get a
Save. This spell requires 2 [dice] to cast against a creature of 5 HD or less, 3
[dice] for a creature between 6 and 8 HD, and 4 [dice] for creatures with more
HD.

### Fatal Doom

R: 10' T: creature D: permanent

You must invest 4 [dice] to cast this spell, and you also drop to 0 HP. You
pronounce a Fatal Doom upon a living creature. The creature must have asked you
for advice, in a non-casual capacity. They must have asked you what to do, where
to go, how to overcome an enemy, or a glimpse into the future. Instead of
calling on a spirit, you read the future directly. You may describe (in one or
two sentences, clear or cryptic) what will happen to the target, and how they
will die. The Doom is inevitable and irreversible. The GM may alter details and
circumstances, but if you say that the target will be hounded from his home by
those he loves and devoured by wolves in the forest, that's how he's going to
die - and soon. Nothing else will kill the target until the Fatal Doom has come
to pass.

### Illusion

R: 50' T: [dice]x5' diameter D: concentration / concentration+1 minute

You create an illusion of whatever object or creature you want. It can move at
your will, but cannot make any sound or smell. Illusions can only add, not
subtract. They can cover up a hole, but not create the illusion of a hole.

### Disguise

R: touch T: object D: [dice] hours / concentration+1 minute

You cloak the object in illusion, making it appear as another object of the same
type. An apple could be disguised as any other type of fruit; a table could be
disguised as any other type of furniture. A humanoid can be disguised as any
other humanoid of comparable size. This only extends to the visual properties of
the object. The maximum size of the object depends on how many dice are invested
in the spell: 1 [dice]: human-sized, 2 [dice]: ogre- or wagon-sized, 3 [dice]:
dragon- or tavern-sized, [dice]: ship- or bridge-sized.

### Mirror Image

R: 0 T: self D: 10 minutes / concentration+1 minute

You create 1d4+[dice] illusory images of yourself, which move as you move and
always stay within 5' of you. They are constantly stepping through each other,
so that it is impossible to tell which is which. When an enemy attacks you, roll
to see if they hit you or an image. An image vanishes as soon as it suffers a
solid impact. Area effects such as a dragon's breath will cause all images to
vanish.

### Mirror Object

R: touch T: mirror D: [dice] hours  / concentration+1 minute

You reach into a mirror-like surface and pull out a copy of an object adjacent
to the mirror. The object that you pull out must be within reach of the mirror
(as if it were a window), small enough to fit through the mirror (as if it were
a window) and light enough for you to pull through with one hand. The mirror
object looks and feels exactly like the object it copied. It doesn't copy any
magical properties of the object. You cannot duplicate living things in this
way. The mirror object pops like a bubble if it suffers a solid blow . If you
invest at least 4 [dice] into this spell, it can copy the magical properties of
an item, but those magical properties will only function once. For items with
continuous properties, such as a flying carpet, the magic properties will last
no longer than 10 minutes.

### Light

R: touch T: object or creature D: [dice]x2 hours

Object illuminates as a torch, with a radius of 20’+[dice]x10’. Alternatively,
you can make an Attack roll against a sighted creature. If you succeed, the
creature is blinded for [sum] rounds. If [sum] is greater than 12, the creature
is permanently blinded. You can chose the colour of the light. If you invest 4
[dice] or more this light has all the qualities of natural sunlight.
Alternatively, if you invest 4 [dice] or more the light can be purest octarine,
although it will only last for 1 round. Octarine light is extremely dangerous.

### Hypnotic Orb

R: touch T: object D: [sum] minutes / concentration+1 minute

You enchant a mostly-spherical object so that it's surface is covered with a
captivating, shimmering pattern. Any creature who sees the enchanted object must
Save or be compelled to sit still and observe it for the spell's duration.
Flying creatures will land or circle it. The caster is not immune to this
effect. The effect is broken if line of sight is broken, if something startles a
target (a loud adjacent shout), or if the target see signs of obvious danger
(such as someone killing their friends). Groups of statistically identical NPCs
should make their Saves as a group.

### Colour Spray

R: [dice]x10' cone T: sighted creatures D: 0 / varies

If [sum] is equal or greater to the creature's HD, it is befuddled for 1d6
rounds. If [sum] is three times the creature's HD or more, it is stunned for a
round, then befuddled for 1d6 rounds. If [sum] is five times the creature's HD,
it is stunned for 1d6 rounds, then befuddled for 1d6 rounds.

### Wall of Light

R: 50' T: wall or sphere D: 10 min / concentration+1 minute

You conjure either (a) a hemisphere [dice]x5’ in diameter, or (b) a 10' by 10'
panel per [dice], which can be arranged in any contiguous formation joined by
their edges. The wall is intangible, but you can control what each side
shows. It can be either (a) inky darkness, (b) light out to 30', (c) mirror, (d)
transparency, or (e) a simple texture, such as stone, brick, or carpet. Both
sides do not have to show the same thing. You can change these surfaces with a
thought. If you invest 4 [dice] or more into this spell, you may make the
duration permanent.

### Mirror Self

R: touch T: mirror D: concentration / concentration+1 minute

You reach into a mirror-like surface and pull out [dice] copies of yourself. The
mirror must be large enough for you to pass through. Your mirror clones behave
as you wish. They can walk and talk, but it cannot pick anything up. You can see
through their eyes and hear through its ears. You can cast spells through
them. You can switch places with your mirror twin as a free action. A mirror
twin pops like a bubble if it suffers a solid blow.

### Fade

R: 50' T: creature or object D: [sum] rounds

Target phases out and becomes unable to affect the world in any way except
visually. It stands or floats like an illusion until the spell concludes. Not
even magic can affect the target. If they would be in a solid object when the
spell expires, they are harmlessly shunted into the nearest open space. The
maximum size of the object depends on how many dice are invested in the spell:

  Dice  |         Size
--------|------------------------
1 [dice]| human-sized
2 [dice]| ogre- or wagon-sized
3 [dice]| dragon- or tavern-sized
4 [dice]| ship- or bridge-sized

### Woman's Work

R: N/A T: N/A D: N/A

With the proper equipment (material components, a cooking pot, water), you can
make [sum] doses of contraceptive, proconceptive, or contramenstrual. These are
universally-accepted trade goods, and can be redeemed for favors, mundane items,
and information. This spell can also be invoked for the safe delivery of an
infant.

### Mending

R: Touch T: Object D: 0

An object made of stone, clay, metal, wood, or fiber can be repaired, restoring
it to the state before it was damaged. The size of the object that can be mended
is dependent on the [dice] invested.

* 1D: Can be held in the hand.
* 2D: Can be held in both hands.
* 3D: Waist height.
* 4D: As big as a person.

Using this spell a second time on the same object carries a 1-in-6 chance of
breaking the object completely, increasing by 1 each time it is mended. Complex
items (clockwork, etc) begin with a 3-in-6 chance of breaking upon casting.

### Produce Flame

R: 40' (when thrown) T: self D: as below

Creates a flame of [sum] damage. The size of the fire is determined by the dice
invested:

* 1D: candle (STR 10, lasts for one hour)
* 2D: torch (STR 30, lasts for fifteen minutes)
* 3D: fire (STR 40, two hands, lasts for five minutes)
* 4D: inferno (STR 70, two hands, takes full turn to cast, movement speed
  halved, cannot be thrown, lasts for one minute)

### Identify

R: 20' T: Object or creature D: 0

Effect depends on the [dice] invested.

* 1D: Caster reveals the common name and mundane properties. If the target has
  been changed by magic, and the potency of the enchantment. Mundane properties
  and names are revealed (ex: "this is phosphorus, it can burn underwater."
* 2D: Caster can determine the above, as well as what kind of magic was
  used. Advanced mundane properties are revealed
* 3D: Caster can determine the above, when it was enchanted, and the effect of
  the enchantment.
* 4D: Caster can determine the above, as well as who created the enchantment.
* 4D + physical piece of target: As above. Learn the true name of the target or
  of the original caster.

### Locate

R: 100' + [sum] x 5 T: Object or creature D: Concentration

The caster can determine the specific location of the target for as long as they
can maintain their concentration.

* 1D: general noun (ex: dog)
* 2D: specific noun (ex: my dog, Old Yeller)
* 3D: vague or immaterial (ex: love, help)
* 4D: paradoxical or impossible (ex: solidified time, a devil's conscience)

If you have a piece of what you are trying to locate, you will be able to know
its exact location at the time of casting, no matter what the range is

### Hidden Language

R: Touch  T: Surface  D: 10 hours

The caster may inscribe a message in a language that has been forgotten by
grown-ups. It may be read only by the very young, the incredibly old, the
simple-minded, and other witches. If 2 [dice] are used, the writing will be
permanent.

### Piercing Look

R: Eyesight  T: Creature(s) whose attention you have D: 0

Target must make an immediate morale check at -4. Gods help them if it is
accompanied by the Crossing of the Arms and the Tapping of the Foot.

### Spare the Dying

R: Touch T: Creature D: [dice] hours

The target, upon hitting death's door, can cling to life for [dice] hours, so
long as they are not injured again. The caster must save against poison each
hour or take 1d6 damage from shouldering the target's pain.

### Magic Circle

R: As drawn T: Spirit D: Until broken

A circle is marked out on the ground which may hold and bind a spirit of [dice]
HD or less. Using this will negate any reaction bonus you might have with the
Folk and impose a further -1 penalty.

* Gain +1 [dice] if the circle is made with salt, iron flakes, or other
  substances anathema to the spirit.
* Gain +2 [dice] if the circle is inscribed with the target's true name.

### Call Upon the Folk

R: 100'  T: Folk  D: 0

The local Folk appear to you, and you gain + [dice] to your reaction roll when
conversing with them. No bonus is granted when dealing with malicious
spirits. Summoning a specific being requires one of the following:

* The location is strongly associated with a particular entity
* [sum] > 15 and knowledge of the entity
* The Folk's true name is known

### Augury

R: Touch T: Creature D: 0

In reading the entrails of sacrificed animals, you look for an omen of what is
to come. You have a [dice] x 10% chance of successfully foreseeing a future
event or gaining a piece of knowledge (ex: "there is a settlement in the next
cave"), plus 1 [dice] per hit die of sacrificed creature or hour spent
cloud-watching. Even if successful, omens will often have multiple potential
meanings.

### Speak with Dead

R: touch T: corpse or other remains D: 10 minutes

You can communicate with ghosts and lingering spirits. The quality of spirit is
determined by both its age and the [dice] invested in the spell.

* 1D: the ghost is silent, and mimes out a repeating loop of a single moment
* 2D: the ghost speaks a little and is no longer locked in action, but remains
  linked to its event
* 3D: the ghost knows who it was in life, and can move about its home freely as
  a normal spirit
* 4D: the ghost is at its most autonomous, bearing jumbled but significant
  memories of life

Ghosts are imprints of an individual, and so do not possess all of that person's
knowledge, nor are they able to provide incredibly specific information unless
it was incredibly important to the target.

### Third Eye

R: Eyesight T: Self D: 10 minutes

The witch is able to see things as they are, not as how they are believed to
be. With her third eye open, the witch is able to see things as they are, not as
how they are believed to be. She may see through illusions, identify secret
doors, see spirits that have hidden themselves, and detect lies.
