## Musical Genres

### Heavy Metal

#### Perk

**Axes Up!:** Your instruments count as d6+STR damage melee weapons, and you can
make attacks with them without interrupting your song.

#### Songs

1. **Breakin' the Law:** You can violate one law of choice without penalties
   while playing this song. Consequences will come later. Intensity 1: law of
   man. Intensity 2: law of nature. Intensity 3: law of god. Intensity 4: law of
   the game.
2. **For Whom the Bell Tolls:** Everyone else in earshot besides your allies
   needs to save or turn their attention to you. At Intensity 2, they approach
   you slowly, with curiosity. At Intensity 3, they run towards you, with
   reckless abandon, and you can exclude people of your choice besides your
   allies. At Intensity 4, they are physically pulled towards you, through
   obstacles and walls.
3. **Master of Puppets:** You animate nearby inorganic material into Intensity
   HD of crude homunculi. They'll follow any orders you can shout while you're
   singing, without interrupting the song. When the song ends, they
   disintegrate.
4. **Paradise City:** Everyone else in earshot must save vs. hallucinations of
   their most positive memories. While hallucinating, at Intensity 1, they have
   disadvantage on saves vs. other mental effects. At Intensity 2, they will
   treat other people as if they're people from the memory. At Intensity 3, you
   can convince them of damn near anything so long as it doesn't break their
   reverie. At Intensity 4, you can shatter the illusion at any time to
   immediately cause them to gain d6 Stress and roll to Crack with disadvantage.
5. **Raining Blood:** A red cloud manifests in the air above your head, and
   stretches as far as your music carries. It rains blood, which obscures vision
   and makes the ground slick. At Intensity 2, you can move the cloud as fast as
   you can run. At Intensity 3, the blood burns, dealing d4 fire and necrotic
   damage to everyone it touches besides you each turn. At Intensity 4, the
   blood melts through thin ceilings and scorches the ground, making it unable
   to grow anything for a year and a day
6. **Realm of Pain:** Unfortunate accidents befall all who hear this music. Each
   round, Intensity of the following effects occur to everyone besides the
   players. At Intensity 2 or greater, you get to pick one of them: (d4) 1. A
   random item on their person shatters, save vs. d4 slashing damage; 2. They
   slip and fall prone, if already prone they save vs. writhing in pain; 3. They
   misspeak, divulging secrets, giving incorrect commands, or babbling
   incoherently; 4. They are flung 10' in a direction at random by sudden gusts
   of wind, if this throws them into an obstacle they save vs. d4 bludgeoning
   damage.
7. **Ride the Lightning:** You summon a lightning bolt that, when you end the
   song, you can travel on to any point within earshot and line of sight. It
   deals (Intensity)d6 lightning damage to everyone at the destination,
   including you. At Intensity 2, it deals damage to everyone and everything it
   passes through. At Intensity 3, you can bring friends you're touching with
   you. At Intensity 4, it passes through walls and obstructions, and you can
   transport d6 times in a row (only take damage on the last one).
8. **Run to the Hills:** You and allies multiply move speed by Intensity, and
   have advantage on tests to perform feats of agility like jumping distances,
   climbing walls, dodging projectiles, etc.
9. **Through the Fire and Flames:** Whenever you or an ally would take elemental
   damage, roll Intensity d6 and reduce the damage by that much.
10. **Tornado of Souls:** The souls of everything that has died within earshot
   in the last day/month/year/forever (Intensity 1/2/3/4) rise to surround you
   in a howling storm. You can make out the barest whispers of information,
   which may be relevant on an Intensity-in-6. Each round, Intensity souls will
   try to possess a body of similar HD to that it had in life within earshot. If
   the body has a soul already, it gets a save vs. possession. When the song
   ends, so does the possession.

### Punk Rock

#### Perk

**Rebel 'Til The End:** You're immune to being charmed. You double your groupie and
busking rolls if you're playing somewhere you're not supposed to.

#### Songs

1. **Unity:** Everyone else within earshot besides your allies must save or else
   be charmed with the following effect... Intensity 1: Stop fighting while the
   song is playing. Intensity 2: Stop fighting for 10 minutes. Intensity 3: Stop
   fighting for 1 hour. Intensity 4: Become friendly and cooperative for 1 hour.
2. **Pet Semetary:** When the song ends, raise Intensity HD undead from nearby
   corpses for 1 hour.
3. **Rat Race:** Whenever an ally would save against being charmed, they add
   Intensity d6 to their Save. If an ally is charmed they may make a save to end
   the effect.
4. **Fall Back Down:** Each turn, each other ally within earshot regains
   Intensity hitpoints.
5. **Plastic Cup Politics:** Any number of targets within earshot must save or
   truthfully answer Intensity questions.
6. **Dammit:** Any number of targets within earshot must save or become
   incredibly self conscious. They lose Intensity d4 Charisma and are paralyzed
   for 1d4 turns if they make a mistake or fail a roll.
7. **The Shark Fighter!:** You and any ally within earshot can swim their normal
   movement speed times Intensity, and can breathe underwater. You can play this
   song underwater and it carries through water as if it was air.
8. **Longview:** Any number of targets within earshot have their Move reduced by
   Intensity d6. They go last in initiative.
9. **Just a Girl:** Up to Intensity targets are treated as invisible by any
   hostile enemies. They can see and hear you, they just don't think you're a
   threat.
10. **2-Tone Army:** You create up to Intensity illusory copies of yourself for
	1d4 minutes. You can move them freely through space, but they cannot
	physically interact with anything.

### Vaporwave

#### Perk

**Cheap Editing Software**: Anything you could reasonably make pleasant noise
with counts as an instrument for you. Additionally, you can choose not to have
the effects of a song happen as you play, and instead store them inside of an
instrument. Expend MD as normal, and they do not refresh until the song is
played. You may release the song at any time, and it will play exactly as you
played it. Intensities change at the same times over the song's duration, and
any Bad Vibes occur when they did. You may store [bard level] songs at a time.

#### Songs

**Important Note:** Imagine these spells look like cutting through the film of a
tape, and then playing it. (The tape is reality.) Uncomfortable warping, strange
colors, flares of light..

1. **Enjoy Yourself:** Everyone in earshot jives and enjoys the song you
   play. Creatures of Intensity HD or more get a save. You may also reroll
   reaction rolls for anyone you talk to while playing this song at a +Intensity
   bonus.
2. **Buy Milk:** You create Intensity*5 buyers, who emerge from cracks in the ground
   and from dark alleys while you play. They are ravenous for purchases, and
   will buy just about anything offered to them. Their wealth varies.
3. **Snake Way:** You conjure the spirits of those you once knew who have died, and
   they dance down from the Snake Way to speak with you while you play. They'll
   answer Intensity questions before departing. People in earshot (including
   you) must save vs sadness as they arrive.
4. **82.99 FM:** For the duration of this song, you are transported up to a maximum
   of Intensity*10 years into the future or the past. When you choose to end
   this song (not when it is ended otherwise) you may return to the time you
   began in. If it is ended prematurely, you remain then until you can return
   with this song or some other means.
5. **Monogon:** Intensity inorganic objects near you become 2-dimensional, flat
   versions of themselves while you play. While playing, you can mentally move
   them anywhere in earshot of the song. They return to normal when you end the
   song.
6. **リサフランク420:** Reality bends around your music. Intensity of the following
   effects can be applied to anything or anyone in earshot. Creatures get a
   save. At 2 Intensity, you get to pick one of them: (d4) 1. The target is
   looped in time, repeating whatever they did before this effect was applied to
   them; 2. The target erupts into jagged, polygonal edges. Objects are
   dangerous, creatures are thorny and weighted down by the mass; 3. An object
   swaps uses with a nearby object (a chair becomes a weapon, or a weapon
   becomes a chair), a creature will switch minds with another nearby creature
   (except the party); 4. The target is slowed to an absolute crawl. If they
   move at all, 1/10 of the usual speed should suffice. Their reaction time
   adjusts accordingly.
7. **Private Caller:** For as long as you play this song, you enter a mental
   realm with one other person of your choice. You control the way this realm
   looks and behaves with just a thought. At 1 Intensity, the person must be
   visible and in earshot. At 2, they need only be in earshot of the song. At 3,
   so long as you know where they are, they will come. At 4, all you need to do
   is think of the person. Both you and the person you call are unaware of the
   actual world during this song.
8. **Summer Night:** Everyone near you must save vs reliving their most painful
   memories. They suffer Intensity d4 damage each round from the torment, unless
   someone tries to touch them while they sit silently, crying. Those touched
   will retaliate violently until the song is over, but they no longer suffer
   from the damage each round while attacking.
9. **Virtually Alone 20xx:** You and Intensity other people are shunted to an
   embryonic world of gray stone, cyan seas and magenta skies for the duration
   of this song. The only other creature in this world is a hostile and insane
   construct resembling you with Intensity*3 HD. It hates you and will try to
   kill you and anyone else here. It may not be near you initially, but it
   senses your presence and will come.
10. **火野 レイ:** Everyone in earshot of this song must save vs. having their
	inhibitions removed for Intensity(1 Intns. Minutes 2 Intns. Hours 3
	Intns. Days 4 Intns. Weeks) or a smaller unit of time, at your desire. They
	will run through the streets nude, chasing after their lover, they will join
	you by banging rudimentary instruments, they will fly to the hills for
	wherever they have always wanted to go, etc.
