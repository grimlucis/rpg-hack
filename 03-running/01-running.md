# Running the Game

## Death and Dismemberment

Monsters die at 0 HP. Important NPCs drop to Dying at 0 HP, and die instantly at
-3. When a PC runs out of HP, they are at 0 HP and can't take any further damage
without risk of death and dismemberment. Further damage (in excess of a PC's HP)
is *lethal* damage, and incurs a roll on the Death and Dismemberment table.

An injury heals one day's worth of healing every day, or every 1 HP of magical
healing that you receive.

Severity = 1d12 + lethal damage + (2 * current injuries)

### Death and Dismemberment Tables

9-10|Disabled 2d6 w| Gored 2d6 w; 1d6 rnds\*: Dying| Concussed 2d6 w; KO'd 1d6 min
11-12|Ruined + Dying | Crushed + Dying | Cracked + Dying

Severity ↓ Type → | Non-lethal    | Fire/Acid | Falls
------------------|---------------|-----------|---------
1-4 |No injury.    |No injury. |Prone
5-6 |Dazed 1 rnd | Burned 1 d |Disabled 1d
7-8 |KO'd 1d6 min| Burned 2d6 d| Disabled 2d6 d
9-10 |KO'd 1d6 min |Burned 2d6 w / Blinded 1d6 d | Disabled 2d6 w
11-12|KO'd 2d6 min| Burned 2d6 w / Blinded | Disabled 2d6 w + Dying
13+ |KO'd 2d6 min| Instantly slain, as above.

**Blinded:** You can't see. If your blindness is permanent, you can make a Save
to recover sight in one eye.

**Burned:** -1 maximum HP per HD.

**Concussed:** Dazed 1 round. 1-in-6 spell failure chance.  Initiative is
halved.

**Cracked:** Concussed 2d6 weeks. Save or permanently lose 1 point of Tal, Wil,
or Cha (random). 30% chance of coma.  Characters in a coma get two chances to
recover, after 1d6 days and 1d6 weeks.

**Crushed:** Gored 2d6 weeks. Save or permanently lose 1 point of STR or DEX
(random). 30% chance of paralysis (equal chance of paraplegy or quadriplegy).
Paralyzed characters get a saving throw to recover fully after 1d6 days and 1d6
weeks.  If both fail, permanent.

**Dazed:** Waste a turn trying to synchronize your blinks.

**Dead:** Say your last words and give your character sheet an appropriate
burial.

**Disabled:** Disarmed or Prone (depending on hit location).  Disabled limbs
cannot be used. A disabled leg gives -6 to Movement. Getting a disabled leg
knocks you Prone. Getting a disabled arm Disarms you.

**Disarmed:** Drop whatever is held in that hand. Items held in both hands have
only a 50% chance to be dropped.

**Dying:** You are unconscious and will die unless someone stabilizes
you. Stabilizing someone requires rolling a d20 and getting half your TAL or
less, with a -1 penalty for every round spent Dying. Regaining any amount of HP
will automatically stabilize you. If no one stabilizes you, you have a 10%
chance of stabilizing yourself after an hour. Unstabilized characters die.

**Gored:** Winded. -1 maximum HP per HD.

**KO’ed:** Unconscious.

**Prone:** On the ground. Standing up takes a turn.

**Ruined:** Make a save. On a success, your limb is Disabled for 2d6 weeks. On a
failure, your limb is permanently Disabled.

**Winded:** -2 to Attack and Defense until you spend a round catching your
breath.

### Trauma and Insanity

**Upon witnessing something horrific:** Player gains 1-3 Trauma Points. They can
make a WIL check to reduce the amount gained by 1. If they've seen it before,
they automatically succeed at this WIL check.

**Upon gaining any amount of Trauma Points:** Player rolls a d20.  If the result
is equal-to-or-less-than their current Trauma Points, they lose all Trauma
Points and suffer a Breakdown.  Breakdowns last for 1d20 rounds. Each time
another player spends a round calming them down, reduce the duration by 1 round.

**At the end of the Breakdown:** Player makes a Save. If they fail, they gain a
permanent Madness.

d6| Breakdowns
--|-----------
1 | Run away.
2 | Hide.
3 | Run away and hide.
4 | Fainting.
5 | Paralyzed, stuttering.
6 | Constant screaming. Roll for encounter.

DM's Tip: This isn't CoC. Even dropping a few Trauma Points on your party can
cause a breakdown or two. Most traumatic things should probably only give a
single Trauma Point (or none with a successful Save).

- If 5 PCs all gain a Trauma Point, there's a 33% chance that there will be at
  least 1 breakdown.
- If 5 PCs all gain 2 Trauma Points, and then gain another Trauma Point, there a
  41% chance that there will be at least 1 breakdown.
- If 5 PCs all gain a Trauma Point, and then gain another Trauma Point, there is
  a 55% chance that there will be at least 1 breakdown.

For each week spent in relaxing, non-threatening surroundings, reduce your
Trauma Points by 1.
