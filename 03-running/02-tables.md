## GM Tables

### Reaction table

Use this if an NPC's, especially a monster's, reaction to a player or party is
unsure.  The meaning of values on the table will differ by situation: a hostile
shopkeeper may give crappy prices or refuse service, whereas a hostile party of
hobgoblins may draw their swords and warn the players to stay back.

2d6   | Reaction
------|-----------
2-3   | Hostile
4-5   | Unfriendly
6-8   | Wary/Neutral
9-10  | Friendly
11-12 | Trusting

### Bonuses and maluses

In general, it is recommended to avoid dice where possible; listening at a door
will definitely pick something up if there's banging and crashing on the other
side, only someone with 5 or less DEX will fail to toss a small object, etc.
Relate the activity to normal life - if a modern human can do it without much
trouble, why can't a heroic adventurer? Equally, don't roll dice if it's
impossible. You can't roll dice to fall 100ft off a sheer cliff and survive.

Description     | Bonus
----------------|-------------
Trivial         | Auto succeed
Very Easy       | +6 or more
Easy            | +4
Straightforward | +2
Tricky          | -2
Hard            | -4
Very Hard       | -6 or less
Impossible      | Auto fail

### Average hitpoints by hit dice

You can use this table to quickly assign hitpoints to a monster without rolling
a handful of d8s. Further than 24, add 4 per HD.
