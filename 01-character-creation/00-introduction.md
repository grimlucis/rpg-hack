# Creating a Character

Creating a character should be fast and easy; especially if you have a concept
in mind beforehand. The process is as follows:

1. Roll your ability scores.
2. Determine who your character is:
   * Choose a race and class.
   * Depending on your class, roll for powers, spells, or abilities.
   * Think up or roll for your background, discussing it with the GM.
   * Name your character!
3. Choose your starting equipment.
