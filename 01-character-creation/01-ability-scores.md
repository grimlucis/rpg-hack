## Ability scores

Roll 3d6 in order for your 5 ability scores:

1. Strength (STR) - physical power, might, physique.
2. Dexterity (DEX) - agility, hand-eye coordination, reflexes.
3. Talent (TAL) - knowledge, quick wits, perception.
4. Willpower (WIL) - Determination, discipline, soundness-of-mind.
5. Charisma (CHA) - Beauty, personality, luck

Your ability bonus for each score is \[(Score/3) - 3\], rounding down:

Score | Bonus
------|------
   3  |  -2
   4  |  -2
   5  |  -2
   6  |  -1
   7  |  -1
   8  |  -1
   9  |   0
  10  |   0
  11  |   0
  12  |   1
  13  |   1
  14  |   1
  15  |   2
  16  |   2
  17  |   2
  18  |   3

For each ability score, record the bonus next to the score on your character
sheet.

After you've rolled, you can optionally swap two ability scores; your race may
also allow you to re-roll an ability score and take the better roll.

### Options for poor characters

If your character comes out particularly poorly, or if the players and GM agree
that they dislike 3d6 in order + swap two, one of the following methods can be
used:

1. Roll 4d6 for each score, taking the three best dice.
2. After rolling six 3d6, assign them to ability scores at will. You can combine
   this with method 1 if your GM is very merciful.
3. Re-roll if a set of scores does not contain at least one 15.
4. Adopt a points-buy system.
5. Get an in-game bonus (special skill, magical weapon, extra spells etc.) if
   none of your ability scores has a bonus above 0 (discuss this with your GM)
