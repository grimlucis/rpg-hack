## Classes

Once you've picked a race, the logical next step is the *class*. This describes
your character's powers and abilities, and where they will fit in with an
adventuring party. Will you sally forth with sword in hand, stand back and use a
bow, or blast your enemies with arcane power? Or perhaps a mix...

### Advancement

Your character advances by amassing Experience Points (XP). This will be
explained in detail in chapter 2. Advancement is as follows:

Level | Hit points | Templates | Attack |  XP
------|------------|-----------|--------|------
   1  |   CON - 4  |     1     |   11   |     0
   2  |   CON - 2  |     2     |   12   |  2000
   3  |     CON    |     3     |   12   |  4000
   4  |   CON + 2  |     4     |   13   |  7000
   5  |   CON + 4  |     -     |   13   | 10000
   6  |   CON + 6  |     -     |   14   | 14000
   7  |   CON + 7  |     -     |   14   | 18000
   8  |   CON + 8  |     -     |   15   | 22000
   9  |   CON + 9  |     -     |   15   | 26000
  10  |  CON + 10  |     -     |   15   | 30000

You cannot advance beyond level 10. At that point you will be a legendary
adventurer known throughout the lands and can safely retire - or pursue
immortality...

You can never have less than 1 or more than 22 hit points. No matter how
experienced you are, a pack of goblins with sharp sticks is still a threat.

### Templates

The first four levels grant you a "template". You can pick from any class, but
note that the most powerful adventurers tend to focus on one class, since each
template is a prerequisite for another - i.e., you cannot get Template B without
first having Template A.

### Warriors

Pugilists, sellswords, men-at-arms. These adventurers live and die by the
sword. The magic-user may have her spells, and the cleric may have his gods, but
you have armor, and a big fucking stick.

There are eleven fighting styles. Some classes will let you pick any; others
will narrow your choices.

   Style     | Description
-------------|------------
  Archery    | You don't have to roll to hit inanimate targets in range. Arrows pierce targets and hit whatever's behind for half damage.
  Brawling   | You do 1d6 damage unarmed. If you crit while unarmed, you get a free extra attack.
   Blunt     | Reroll 1s on damage rolls with blunt weapons.
 Dual-wield  | No Attack penalty for dual wielding.
  Duelist    | Using a one-handed sword, you get +1 to your Defense
 Greatshield | You gain advantage on your next attack if your enemy misses. Shields only count for one inventory slot.
Great Weapon | If you kill an enemy with a two-handed weapon, you regain 1 HP.
Improvisation| +2 critical range when fighting with an improvised weapon.
   Reaver    | If you do 6+ damage with a slashing weapon, your opponent loses a limb.
  Spearwall  | Adjacent allies get +1 Defense if you're wielding a piercing weapon. Double reach with piercing weapons.
  Throwing   | Crits with throwing weapons cause them to return to you. If you have a free hand, you can throw a weapon on your turn as a bonus action.

#### The Barbarian

You're not from around here, and people find you strange, but people are people
and gold is gold. You're fearsome in battle, able to drink anyone from this
place under the table, and a worthy addition to any team of adventurers.

**Starting Equipment:** Leather armor, two-handed weapon.

Template |             Bonus
---------|-------------------------------
A    | Rage, +1 Fighting Style
B    | Danger Sense, A Taste of Home
C    | Feat of Strength, Die Hard
D    | Tough, +1 Fighting Style

You gain +2 HP for each Barbarian template you possess. You get +1 Stealth if
you possess 2 Barbarian templates.

**Rage:** You can choose to enter a rage at the start of your turn, or in
response to taking damage. While in a rage, you have +1 Attack stat, all your
melee attacks inflict +1 damage, and are immune to pain and fear. You might
froth, or stare in battle-focus, or merely let a facade drop and give in to your
ancient urges, brutal warrior training, or religious fanaticism.

While raging, you cannot do anything defensive, curative, or tactical with your
allies. All you can do is attempt to kill things. Spellcasting is not
impossible, but all your spells must be damaging spells, which deal +2 damage
(if single target) or +1 damage (if multiple targets). Mishaps and Dooms may be
more severe. While raging, you cannot stop fighting until you kill, subdue, or
drive off all enemies. You can will yourself to stop raging with a 2-in-6 chance
of success at the start of your turn as a free action. If one of your allies has
injured you this fight, they count as an enemy.

**Fighting Styles:** You can take any fighting style you wish.

**Danger Sense:** If you are surprised, you have a 50% chance to act on the
surprise round anyway. If you encounter a creature no one in the group has seen
before, you can roll under your Intelligence to remember a detail or weakness,
provided the creature is not unique.

**A Taste of Home:** You can consume a special ration to regain 1d6+1 HP. This
takes 1 round. Examples: an alcoholic drink, a strange fruit or vegetable, an
unusual herb. One use costs 1gp and can be purchased in any trading city. 3
"doses" fit in a single inventory slot. You cannot do this while raging, but you
can immediately enter a rage after eating the ration. If you have any Lethal
Damage, you instead heal to 0 HP. If an ally waves the ration under you nose,
you can Save vs Constitution to wake up. You may play a theme tune (or a
leitmotif, if you're classy).

**Feat of Strength:** Once per day as a free action, you have 22 Strength for 1
round. Can also be used in combat (your Strength Bonus is 4).

**Die Hard:** You have 4 rounds to remove all your Fatal Wounds, rather than 3.

**Tough:** Reduce all incoming damage by 1 point. You gain a +2 to Save vs <!--  -->
mind-altering spells.

#### The Knight

A strong young man, he considers himself courteous and chivalrous, and indeed,
he can be quite affable when necessary. He is treated with respect by the
nobility, and looked upon as a champion by the common people. But make no
mistake - he is highly trained in combat, and he does not lose.

**Starting Equipment:** Chainmail. One-handed weapon of choice. Shield bearing
your heraldry. Horse. 10 silver pieces.

Template |             Bonus
---------|-------------------------------
A    | Challenge, +1 Fighting Style
B    | Bodyguard, +1 attack per round
C    | Parry, +1 Fighting Style
D    | Aura of Courage, Dragon Slayer

Knights are trained in **Fighting Styles** by masters-at-arms, and thus will
only learn "honorable" styles; sword-and-board or maybe blunt weapons are a
must.

**Challenge:** This ability only works on creatures that can understand you and
are capable of being offended. If you challenge a creature outside of combat,
they must make Save to resist accepting. In civilized areas, this is basically a
duel, and this means that you and the other party must agree upon the time, the
place, the weapons, the victory condition, and the stakes. Leaders will usually
send out a champion to fight in their stead (if applicable). In combat, you can
challenge one creature each turn by yelling at it as a free action. The creature
must Save . If they fail, they will attack you. This ability cannot force an
opponent to make major tactical errors or leap off cliffs.

**Bodyguard:** If an adjacent ally would take damage from a physical attack, you
can choose to take the damage for them. This ability has a 4-in-6 chance of
succeeding.

**Parry:** Once per day you can reduce incoming damage by 1d12 points. If you
also choose to sunder your shield, you can reduce the damage by 12 points
instead of 1d12.

**Aura of Courage:** Adjacent allies can use your Save vs Fear in place of their
own. This ability has no effect if you are currently afraid.

**Dragon Slayer:** Once per day, you can cause one of your physical attacks to
deal +X damage, where X is equal to the HD of the highest level monster your
party has ever killed. You must keep track of this. If you miss, this ability is
not expended.

#### The Veteran

On a beautiful summer day ripe with the musk of freshly felled hay, your country
called you to fight. Or, after the raiders had left, you crawled over to the
mace in your mother’s cold hand and swore to kill every last one of them. Or,
after the sermon, with the priest’s shouts of blasphemy burning hard and bright
in your mind, you bought an old sword with intent.

It doesn’t matter.

There were battles, bonds made and broken, men and women laid out on the ground,
blue with the blanket of death. You stacked rocks with scabbed, trembling
fingers atop the bodies of your friends, or brothers, or sisters.

It doesn’t matter.

What matters is that you are now breaking the oath you made after your last
battle. Against all reason, against the tenuous feeling of your body, against
the little voice in your head saying that now, you might actually die, you have
picked up arms once again.

There is something. A person, a promise through shredded lips, a doubt. You will
not rest until they are dead, or the promise fulfilled, or the doubt assuaged,
or your own death.

Whatever it is, though the gates of hell stand in your way, you will blast them
down and with your last breath seize your prize.

**Starting Equipment:** Studded leather armor. Choice of weapon:

1. Bow, 20 arrows, shortsword.
2. Shield, one-handed weapon (arming sword, mace, axe, etc.)
3. Great weapon (Longsword, polearm, warhammer, etc.)

Template |                  Bonus
---------|---------------------------------------------
A    | +2 Old Wounds, Pangs, Vow, +1 Fighting Style
B    | Drinking Buddies, Weathered, +1 Attack
C    | Scores, Recall, +1 Fighting Style
D    | Venerable Glory, +1 Attack

**Old Wounds** are the injury you suffered in your previous life come back to
haunt you. Fragments of your skills remain, but using them risks tearing
something. Your Old Wound dice are represented by d6’s.

When you hit with a weapon, you may roll any number of your WD (Wound Dice) in
addition to damage. If the attack roll was even, add all even WD to damage; if
the attack roll was odd, add odd WD instead. Sum all the WD that you didn't add
and trigger the relevant Pang, then expend those dice until tomorrow.

When you take damage, you may roll any number of your WD. If the damage was
even, subtract all even WD from damage; if the damage was odd, subtract odd WD
instead. Sum all the WD that you didn't add and trigger the relevant Pang, then
expend those dice until tomorrow. If you reduce an instance of damage to 0 using
WD, you automatically trigger a relevant Pang with the sum you used to defend.

**Pangs** are what you suffer when your Old Wounds stir again. They range from
mildly debilitating symptoms to devastating reopenings of old wounds. When your
dice don’t match up as detailed above, check the sum of the unmatched dice,
consult the Pangs table, and suffer its effects.

Your **Vow** is the reason you bear arms again. You will not rest until it is
completed. You will never act in a way that directly contradicts your Vow, and
if you are charmed to act against it, you can make one additional save with a +1
bonus for every Veteran template you have.

For every Veteran template you gain without breaking your Vow, you get +1 to
saves against effects that would instantly kill you.

Pick a **Fighting Style** and pick it well.

**Drinking Buddies** are people you served with, veterans of your war(s). You
can call upon them for a small favor, like dinner and a place to sleep for the
night, or an audience with the local baron. You may ask them for a larger favor,
but they’ll ask a favor of you in return. There's at least 1 Drinking Buddy in
any small town, and more in larger settlements.

You’re **Weathered** from past trauma. If your game uses stress points, trauma
dice, or similar mechanics, you can ignore the first time these effects
trigger. You can sleep outdoors in your armor (unless it’s plate) comfortably as
long as weather conditions permit, and you have +1 to saves against exhaustion
for every Veteran template you possess.

**Scores** are relics of your violent past that bubble to the surface as word
spreads that you bear arms again. When you return to town after some time spent
adventuring, roll a dice.

On evens, a person you served with, a Drinking Buddy, or a relative of such will
seek your help avenging a major wrong.

On odds, an old enemy, a Drinking Buddy you offended, or a relative of someone
whose death you were responsible for is waiting for you to settle affairs.  If
you reject pleas for aid or put off resolving old conflicts, your Drinking
Buddies will no longer extend aid until you tie up loose ends. For every Score
you settle, you can reroll a Pang you dislike one time.

You may **Recall** knowledge from your past life. Once a day, you can make a
skill check as if you knew about the relevant topic.

You are, now and forever, a **Venerable Glory**. The first time you kill a
creature in combat, all hostile, sentient creatures must Save or refuse to
attack you until you deal damage to them.

1. Right arm

**How Did I Get This Wound? (1d6)**

### Spellcasters

There's the nobility, the clergy, the unwashed masses... and then there are the
wizards, sorcerers, witches, and necromancers. Spellcasters are squishy, don't
often get to use real weapons, and are almost all doomed to madness. In
exchange, they *get to use magic.* This puts the spellcaster in a unique
position. Taverns go quiet when old men in pointy hats come in. Kings may pay
illusionists in gold just to sit around looking threatening. No matter how many
witch-hunting paladins come by, most villages will never reveal the witches in
their presence. Necromancers rarely lack for sources of coin in exchange for an
opportunity to speak to a loved one just one last time.

#### Wizards and Witches

**Starting Equipment:** spellbook, ink, quill. Some schools may give additional
items.

Template |                       Bonus
---------|------------------------------------------------------
A    | +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot, +2 Spells (1-6), Spell Breeding
B    | +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot, +1 Spell (1-8), Book Casting
C    | +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot +1 Spell (1-10), Friendly Spell
D    | +1 MD, +1 Spell Slot, Master of Magics

You gain +1 Magic Die (MD) and +1 Spell Slot for each Wizard template you
possess, to a maximum of 4 each.

When you first gain a Wizard template, you must choose a school from the list
below. You cannot change schools later.

1. Orthodox Wizards; good all-rounders who are well-respected and versatile.
2. Illusionists; colorful but manipulative wizards.
3. Necromancers; morally grey magicians that consult with, and raise, the dead.
4. Witches

As you level, you will gain spells from your school’s spell list. You still can
learn and cast spells from outside your school, but until you cast them 8 times,
MD spent on them do only return on a 1, rather than a 1-3.

The last two spells on your school's spell list are the **Emblem Spells,** the
"classic" spells of a school.

**Spell Breeding**

You can attempt to crossbreed and combine two spells into one new spell. Both
spells need to be stored on separate scrolls initially. This process takes 1
week of uninterrupted work. You can combine the spells to produce one of the
following:

1. a random spell from your spell list (roll 1d10)
2. a random spell from a random spell list
3. a mutant version of one of the two spells

When the process is complete, Save or suffer a Mishap. Gain a +1 bonus to Save
for:

1. every 1 gp spent on reagents, inks, magical artifacts, incense, or other
   tools of your trade
2. the number of Wizard templates you possess
3. each ritual preparation you describe to the GM
4. the number of times you'd previously cast the spells you are combining

**Book Casting**

You can cast from a scroll or a spellbook in a way that does not consume the
scroll. This allows you to cast directly from your spellbook without loading the
spell into your brain first. You do not gain the bonus MD that consuming a
scroll generates. You must declare you are casting a spell from a book before
initiatives are rolled for the turn.You automatically go last in the initiative
round, and you automatically fumble the spell if you take any damage during the
round. The spell vanishes from the scroll or book and returns the next morning.

**Friendly Spell**

Choose 1 spell you know and have frequently cast. Apply a positive mutation to
the spell. Do not roll on the drawbacks table, even if the mutation requests
that you do.

**Master of Magics**

Learn up to 6 spells from your school’s spell list, or invent an entirely new
spell (GM’s discretion).

##### Orthodox Wizards

Orthodox wizards are chartered, historic, and sensible wizards. Their colleges
only accept male students, but in small struggling colleges, anyone with a false
beard and a sack of gold will do. It’s an open and widely mocked secret.
Orthodox wizards study all fields of magic, test theories, explore tombs, and
fight in wars. Their red robes are famous; to many peasants, a wizard without
red robes isn’t a wizard at all.

You are expected to report new discoveries and spells back to your college. You
are also expected to develop new spells. Should you survive and pay off your
Wizard Student Loans, you may even be offered a faculty position. You might also
find a position in the court of a noble, assuming you do not have ambitions
above your station, and the noble is willing to tolerate the eccentricities of
wizards.

**Perk:** You start with red robes.

**Drawback:** None.

**Cantrips:**

1. Change the colour or texture of an object no larger than a horse for 10
   minutes.
2. Create a tiny light as bright as a match on your fingertip.
3. Move a light object with a wave of your finger. You could cause a coin to
   roll along the ground or turn the pages of a book, but you couldn't open a
   door or lift a stone.

Having no drawback is a rarity, even if your perks and cantrips aren't very
impressive. They are good classic orthodox cantrips.

**Spell list:**

1. Lock
2. Knock
3. Grease
4. Force Field
5. Levitate
6. Magic Missile (As an Orthodox Wizard, your spell is unique to you, and can be
   any colour, shape, or pattern you describe.)
7. Feather Fall
8. Sleep
9. Light
10. Wizard Vision
11. Prismatic Ray
12. Fireball

**Mishaps:**

1. MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours
2. Take 1d6 damage
3. Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then make a save. Permanent if you fail.
4. Lose 1 MD for 24 hours.
5. Agony for 1d6 rounds.
6. Cannot cast spells for 1d6 rounds.

**Doom of the Orthodox:**

1. Lose the ability to cast spells for 1 day.
2. Lose the ability to cast spells for 3 days.
3. Lose the ability to cast spells permanently.

This doom can be eating the heart of a powerful magical creature, such as a High
Elf or a dragon, or by marrying one. You can also fill your brain with 4
entirely new spells that have never been cast by anyone else.

##### Illusionists

Orthodox Wizards, and the nobility, begrudgingly accept Illusionists as
chartered wizards. They can be seen as sketchy and crafty, and their mastery of
mirrors is considered suspect. Still, they're seen as "mostly harmless".

As an Illusionist, of course, you know that you're anything but harmless.

**Perk:** Your Illusion spells have a duration of “Concentration + 1
minute”. You start with rainbow-coloured gloves.

**Drawback:** You cannot cast spells unless you can see all 7 primary
colours. Your magic supplies the 8th: octarine, the color of magic.

**Cantrips:**

1. Create a shower of illusory sparks or a puff of illusory smoke from your
   hands.
2. Touch another caster’s illusion and make and Opposed Intelligence check. If
   you succeed, you gain control of the illusion.
3. You always know the position of the sun in the sky.

**Spell List:**

In this setting, spells are creatures. They're spirits that live in a wizard's
brain and burst out, doing their duty and then taking a brief
vacation. Elementalists have brains like stables or kennels. Illusionists, who
rely on more sentient spells, have brains like carnivals or traveling circus
wagons. Illusionists feed their spells on coloured light. Illusion spells need
all 8 colours to manifest. Any less, and feeble, flickering images will appear
from the undernourished spell.

1. Illusion
2. Disguise
3. Prismatic Ray
4. Mirror Image
5. Mirror Object
6. Light
7. Hypnotic Orb
8. Colour Spray
9. Wizard Vision
10. Wall of Light
11. Mirror Self
12. Fade

**Mishaps:**

1. MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours
2. Take 1d6 damage
3. Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then Save. Permanent if you fail.
4. Blind for 1d6 rounds
5. All sighted creatures are invisible to you for 24hrs.
6. Eruption of random illusions from your hands. Everyone in LOS must make a
   Wisdom check to do anything relying on sight for 1d6 rounds.

**Doom of the Illusionist:**

1. A 10’ square mirror appears and you are compelled to enter. Your lose a
   random item, gain a random item of approximately equal value, and have 0
   HP. You return the next morning, shivering.
2. You turn into an illusion for a day.
3. Turn into an illusion permanently.

As an illusion, you have no smell or taste. You cannot be felt. Solid impacts
cause you to pop. Lose 1d6 Con that cannot be recovered while you are an
illusion, and reform the next morning nearby. Illusions are real to you.

This doom can be avoided by journeying into the mirror-realm and eating one of
the eyes of the Eye Tyrants found there, or performing the Ritual of Prismax; a
duel to the death against three of your mirror selves, fought in a neutral
battlefield.

##### Necromancers

Necromancers are outlawed and outcast wizards. Their profession is a curse;
their very name a byword for unholy acts and blasphemous deeds. Yet the
necromancers persist on the fringes of society. They provide a relatively safe
channel between the living and the dead, and someone will always pay - one way
or another - for information only the dead can provide. In Foreign Parts, the
necromancer's art is celebrated and sometimes even revered. One of the standard
list of charges brought against foreign kings and corrupt leaders is "consulting
with necromancers."

**Perk:** You can cause creatures you touch to reroll any Fatal Wounds they are
trying to remove in a round. You can allow them to reroll failed tests or force
them to reroll successful tests. If a creature successfully removes a Fatal
Wound because of the reroll you provided, it permanently loses 1 HP.

**Drawback:** You require a ritual ingredient to cast your spells. The
ingredient has a negligible cost (2cp) and is not consumed, but water, fire, or
isolation could render you unable to cast spells. Roll on the Ritual Ingredient
List below.

**Cantrips:**

1. You can call on the spirit of a recently dead creature by interrogating its
   body. Provided the creature died before dawn, and it wasn't particularly
   pious or exceptionally blasphemous, it will answer 3 of your questions. At
   dawn, the spirit departs. The dead are rarely coherent or helpful. Answers
   may be cryptic. If the creature had 3 or more HD, everyone present can see
   and hear the spirit. Otherwise, only you can see it.
2. You can ritually protect a corpse against possession by unwelcome
   spirits. Alternatively, you can deliberately invite spirits to possess a
   corpse. The ritual takes 10 minutes. The most dangerous time is between death
   and dawn; after that, the corpse becomes less appealing to wandering spirits.
3. You can permanently lose 1 HP to add 1 MD to a spell you are casting. You can
   only lose 1 HP per spell.

**Spell List**

In this setting, spells are creatures. They're spirits that live in a wizard's
brain and burst out, doing their duty and then taking a brief vacation. While
most wizard schools breed spells specifically, necromancers might keep a cadre
of ghosts. Some necromancers cast their own ancestors as spells; some trap
escaped ghosts and wield them in a form of holy penance.

You automatically gain **Raise Spirit** for your first spell; roll for your
second spell as usual.

Many spells on this list require a bit of GM improvisation. The spells are much
less straightforward than a traditional spell list. They are also dangerous to
both the caster and their companion. Raise ye not up what ye cannot put down.

1. Raise Spirit
2. Explode Corpse
3. Death Mask
4. Fear
5. Rot
6. Raise Undead
7. Innocent Revenant
8. Command Undead
9. Fog
10. Death Scythe
11. Finger of Death
12. Fatal Doom

**Mishaps:**

1. MD only return to your pool on a 1-2 for 24 hours
2. Take 1d6 damage
3. Random mutation for 1d6 rounds, then make a Save. Permanent if you fail.
4. Save vs Fear against the target of your spell. 1d6 rounds. Target is fully
   healed if undead.
5. 1d6 nearby corpses raise as zombies and attack you for 1d6 rounds.
6. You die. Save vs Intelligence every hour to find your way back to your body.

**Doom of the Necromancer:**

1. You die and spend the next 1d6 days wandering Creation as a disembodied,
   feeble spirit. Your body will rot after 2 days unless it is preserved in some
   way: pickling, embalming, freezing, or desiccation. If you inhabit a rotting
   body, you become undead.
2. You become undead, permanently. If you were already undead, you instead lose
   6 HP permanently.
3. By direct decree of the Authority, all corpses in 20 miles rise as zombies
   and skeletons and attempt to kill you. If you have been particularly
   notorious, they will be accompanied by 2 Bell Exorcists and a demon. Average:
   3d20 skeletons, with 1d6 lieutenants, monsters, and commanders as
   appropriate. Anyone they kill joins them. They will pursue you to the ends of
   the earth.

This doom can be avoided by eating the heart of an immortal creature, or
journeying into hell and make a bargain to serve the Authority, or becoming a
Lich.

**Becoming a Lich:**

You need to breed and research 8 specific spells. The spells don't do anything
alone, but they modify your soul to withstand the terrors of undeath with your
mind intact. You are essentially breeding and then grafting spells onto your
soul.

Since no active liches will teach you the spells they used, and records of spell
development are fragmentary at best, each lich must forge their own path. Some
succeed; many fail, and fade away into half-mad shadows or disappear screaming
into Hell. Other liches become trapped in living worlds of madness and memory,
unable to accept their new form or the the changing times. History is full of
Immortal Tyrants; they never quite manage to rule the empires they desire.

**Ritual Ingredient List:**

1. Salt
2. Ash
3. A clay bottle
4. A round blue stone
5. A piece of carved and polished bone
6. A grey metal bell with no clapper
7. A twig with three forks and one dead leaf
8. The front leg of a cat
9. A dried frog in a pouch
10. Powdered teeth

##### Witches

People make their entrance on the world's stage screaming bloody murder and
covered in fluids. It's a terrifying experience for all and sundry, which is why
most folks are just fine with only being born once.

The important part is what comes right after. The first person you will meet,
even before you're set to sucking at your mother's teat, is a witch. She might
be a hundred and three years old and blind, deaf, and toothless, or she might be
fourteen and pimple-faced with boots two sizes too big, but she'll be there.

Witches live on the outside and look in. They live in places between, with boots
caked in muck and brains full of things other people can't or won't see. They
intercede, between man and his neighbors, between man and the Folk, between man
and the gods. They are a vital, central part of the community, but they are not
part of it fully.

You don't go to a witch for comfort. Mother will ease your pain and tell you
that everything will be all right, but a witch has no such obligation. They deal
in truth, and truth is useful and painful in equal measure. It is something to
both live and die for, and in the case of witch-hunters, something to kill
people over.

Contrary to what wizards and noblewomen who like to call themselves witches
might say, witches do not have anything to do with dancing around in the
moonlight with no clothes on (at least, not sober witches).

**Perk:** You get +2 to reaction rolls when interacting with the rural poor and
working class, and people with a bit of sense.

**Drawback:** You get -2 to reaction rolls when interacting with wizards,
politicians, academics religious leaders, fundamentalists of all stripes, and
people with not nearly enough sense. You get no reaction bonus, not even from
Charisma, when dealing with other witches.

**Cantrips:**

1. You can spend five minutes to create a shamble, which allows you to detect if
   magic has been worked nearby. It will only tell you yes / no and relative
   strength.
2. You always have a piece of string, a stub of chalk, a smooth pebble and a
   coin in your pocket.
3. You can silently summon your familiar. This may take a few minutes if they
   are far away.

A note on familiars: familiars are ordinary animals that can be sent out to do
ordinary animal things. they cannot speak and you are not mind linked, but they
are smarter than usual and will tell you what they might see or do in their own
way.

**Spell List:**

1. Woman's Work
2. Mending
3. Produce Flame
4. Identify
5. Locate
6. Hidden Language
7. Piercing Look
8. Spare the Dying
9. Magic Circle
10. Augury
11. Speak With Dead
12. Third Eye
13. Call Upon The Folk

**Mishaps:**

1. Take 1d6 damage.
2. Grass dies, flowers wilt, milk spoils in a 50' radius.
3. Vomit cobwebs, hair, and tomato juice for 1d6 rounds.
4. Familiar vanishes for 1d6 hours.
5. Bleed from forehead for 1d10 hours, freaks everyone out.
6. Transformed into a cat for 1d6 hours. You can still cast spells.

**Dooms:**

1. A bleak mood lingers on you like grease on fingers. Your reaction malus is
   doubled for 24 hours.
2. A witchhunter demon has been drawn to your scent. It cannot harm you
   directly, but it will follow you for three days, dealing mental strain damage
   through its attacks. If damage > WIL, the witch must save vs fear - on
   success, fight/flight/freeze. On fail,you will be rendered too strained to
   make any normal action at all until the days have transpired.
3. You've gone too far on the outside, cut your ties to people, lost the things
   that keep you grounded. You've gone bad, a hag of the worst kind.

This doom can be avoided by pulling the millstone-in-the-pond trick in
Clearsight Lake, or by delivering an accurate omen to a king and watching the
fallout to the end.

### The Clergy

### The Rogues

Many of the other adventurers have something special about them; a magical
talent, a connection with the gods, or just a knack for violence. But there is a
place in an adventuring party for an ordinary person who approaches problems a
little more creatively than others.

These people are more than a little sketchy, existing on the fringes of society,
probably have a bounty on their head in some towns but are local heroes in
others. Whatever their call to adventuring they share a certain uniqueness, and
provide for the player a fun, different playing style.

#### The Bard

You've always had a talent for singing. In fact, you can sing so well, word of
your talents spread beyond your hometown, attracting the attention of a master
bard. Before you knew it, you had an instrument in hand, and were learning how
to *really* sing.

Talented bards can expect to perform for at least a warm bed and a hot meal;
*really* talented bards are sought after by kings and noblemen. To be one of
these, you'll need a song to sing; or rather, a repertoire. Where better to find
stories of which to sing than on the road adventuring?

**Starting Equipment:** Instrument of choice, pile of assorted sheet music,
parchment, quill and ink, earplugs for your party members

---------|------------------------------------------------------
A    | Music is Magic, Genre, 2 Songs
B    | Busking, +2 Songs
C    | Groupies, +2 Songs
D    | Arena Anthems, +2 Songs

**Music is Magic:** You can sing magic songs. Even when you're singing mundane
songs, you can evoke powerful but nonspecific emotions in all listeners by
expending a Music Die (you can make listeners feel amorous, but not towards
particular people; you can make listeners feel deeply sad, but not
suicidal). Whenever a significant event happens around you (the death of a party
member, a climactic battle, a budding or dying romance, etc.), you can write a
new song about it. Bards can teach each other bards magic songs, even outside
their genres.

**Genre:** Pick a Genre (See section 6.3: Musical Genres). You have its Genre
perk and learn your songs from it.

**Busking:** During a long rest in town, you can spend your time busking on
street corners and in market squares to get (Bard level)d6 gold in assorted
small change from passers-by, as well as a local rumor.

**Groupies:** You can play a gig in town or anywhere with a sympathetic
audience. It attracts (Bard level)d6 audience members (increase or decrease the
die size for larger or smaller venues), and Bard level of them will come along
with you as groupies. They won't usually put themselves in harm's way, but
they'll do minor tasks for you and carry your stuff. Whenever you give them a
Bad Vibe, one leaves. They'll all disperse when you go back to town, but might
sign back on at your next gig.

**Arena Anthems:** Your voice and songs can carry for up to a mile.

**Music Rules**

You have MD (Music Dice) equal to your Bard level plus one. Songs
begin at 1 Intensity, and as you play a song, you have 3 chances (one each
round) to expend any number of MD to try to boost the Intensity (this doesn't
take an extra action, it's part of playing the song). To do so, roll the MD
you're using. If one or more of your MD show a 4-6, boost the song and increase
its dice by 1, then expend the die. Any dice that roll 1-3 are returned to your
pool. If you roll a 1, there's a Bad Vibe, which might end the song entirely. MD
return on a short rest.

**Bad Vibes:**

1. Burnout. You can't sing this song for the rest of the day, and have to stop
   immediately.
2. Hoarse. Lose your ability to sing above a whisper. Until you spend a day
   recuperating, no one besides you can hear your songs.
3. Snapped. Your instrument breaks and is unusable until you spend a short rest
   repairing it.
4. Lost The Tune. Invert the effect of the song this round, then it ends.
5. Voice Crack. Anyone listening can voluntarily ignore the effects of the song,
   and any further songs you sing, until the end of the day.
6. Earworm. You can't sing any other songs for the rest of the day.

When you take damage the song decreases in Intensity by 1 die, unless you have
other Bards backing you up and covering for you. If this brings it to 0, the
song ends. Taking actions that would interrupt the song end it entirely.

Additional Bards playing the same song can expend MD to nullify Bad Vibes. Bards
can join in on any song a Bard with the same Genre is playing whether or not
they know it, but they can't boost it unless they know it too, just salvage it.

#### The Jack

You're not particularly strong, or skilled with a sword. You haven't got any
magical talent. If the gods are real, they probably don't think much of you.
You're not even any good at stealing things, and while you may have a nice
singing voice you're not going to be doing anything otherworldly with it.  What
you do have is a silver tongue, a lover in every port, an effortlessness in
social situations that is the envy of even other rogues.

Being a Jack is all about knowing the right people and the right skills to solve
any problem. Some call you a Fixer; because you're the type of person that gets
shit done.

**Starting Equipment:** Weapon of choice small enough to hide under your clothes
(daggers yes, battleaxes no), fancy clothes (3 sets), hireling buddy you
convinced to go on this adventure against their better judgment

A    | I Know a Guy, Trustworthy Face, 2 Contact Dice
B    | Con Artist, +1 CD
C    | Lover Not a Fighter, +1 CD
D    | Fake It 'Til You Make It, +1 CD

I Know a Guy: You have Contact Dice, which are d6s. Spend them to realize you
know or get to know someone in a location, and roll 1 die for each feature you
want them to have. The extent and usefulness of the feature is based on how well
you roll. You can spend multiple dice on one feature to take the highest of
those dice. If you roll doubles when making a Contact, also roll a
Complication. Spent Contact Dice return on a long rest, or when you enter a new
town.

**Sample Features:**

- Information: 1. Common local wisdom → 6. Secrets known to few
- Item: 1. With some creative thinking, what they have might be useful
  → 6. They've got exactly what you need and more
- Location: 1. Temporary access to a generic kind of place you're looking for
  → 6. Round-the-clock access to the exact venue you need
- Relationship: 1. You met once, a long time ago → 6. You've been close since
  childhood
- Skill: 1. Decent at a relevant skill → 6. Multiple class levels
- Status: 1. Trusted by locals → 6. Official title and position of power

**Complications:**

1. They want a favor from you before they help you out.
2. They're laying low and can't do anything that'd attract attention.
3. They're harder to reach than usual, perhaps temporarily in prison, or on a
   trip out of town.
4. They're doing something you find distasteful, perhaps at cross purposes to
   your aims.
5. They're working with/in a relationship with someone who doesn't like you,
   who'll be around making their own demands.
6. Their value to you has been misrepresented somehow. Decrease their highest
   feature by 2.

**Trustworthy Face:** If you aren't in open combat with someone, they're going
to be a little less hostile to you (but not necessarily the rest of the party)
than they would be to your average murderhobo. If you speak their language,
upgrade their reaction to you by one category, or downgrade it if you want to.

**Con Artist:** So long as no one can verify what you’re saying is wrong, you
can lie through your teeth and they’ll believe you for at least d6 minutes. You
can walk through somewhere unquestioned if you look like you belong and don't
act suspicious for at least d6 hours, so long as you don't start talking to
people. With a daily rest of practice and study, you can learn the basics of a
skill to the point where untrained onlookers will believe you know what you're
doing until you fail a roll. Expires on your next daily rest.

**Lover Not a Fighter:** You can make attacks with Charisma vs. your enemy's
Wisdom if they speak your language. If you do, the attack inflicts Stress
instead of damage. You may make the penalty for failing the Stress roll changing
their reaction by 1, instead of Cracking.

**Fake It 'Til You Make It:** If you get a long rest of training from someone
with levels in a class, you can use that class's level 1 abilities until you
fail a roll on them. Can't do it again until you go back and get pointers on how
to do it during a long rest in town. You can have access to multiple fake
classes at once, but you can't get abilities above level 1.

2d6|Reaction
---|--------
2-3| Hostile
4-5| Unfriendly
6-8| Wary
9-10| Friendly
11-12| Trusting

For when you need to apply Trustworthy Face/Lover Not a Fighter, or figure out
the kind of first impressions an NPC gets of the party. Obviously as a GM you
can apply whatever bonuses/penalty you want, rule out certain reactions for
things like dragons or drow, or just set reactions at your whim.

These can mean different things based on the context! With a shopkeeper,
Unfriendly might mean a significant markup for the heavily armed murderhobos who
cause nothing but trouble; Hostility might be outright refusal of service. With
a pack of dire wolves, Trusting could mean they see a fellow pack, and treat you
as they would another band of wolves they're on good terms with.

If multiple individuals in a group have different Reactions, they might fall
into infighting or argument between each other. A Jack who uses their Lover Not
a Fighter skills to turn a gang of bandits against each other is a force to be
reckoned with. Getting a leader to change their reaction is likely to get the
rest of the group to change their opinions - or fight each other.
