# Setting

## Moongates

Allegedly built by the owl-folk's ancestors, moongates are circular portals
which appear throughout the lands. Usually they are inactive, and are simply
stone circles; however, during certain moon phases (depending on the gate) they
will spring to life. If you sit by a moongate as the night approaches during its
active phase, at sunset as the light fades around you the moongate will glow and
the inside of the circle will be replaced by a shining white surface. Once the
sun sets, and as it creeps closer to twilight, the light will fade. At thirty
minutes to midnight, the light will have dissipated completely, and a
destination will be visible through the moongate.

From 23:30 to 00:30, you can use active moongates to travel. Passing through a
moongate will essentially teleport any creature that can fit to a paired
moongate somewhere else on the planet. Certain very large and very secluded
moongates even lead to other planets, planes, or universes; such a moongate will
only be active for one day a year, and will attract powerful magical creatures
such as elementals, demons, and outsiders.

Trained astrologers, witches with proper equipment, and owl-folk spellcasters
can find moongates through scrying or consulting astrological charts. Knowledge
of moongates near civilization is a closely guarded secret, for fear of armies
marching through them. Many moongates are protected by magical servants,
powerful enchantments, or territorial creatures.

Moongates that are destroyed by any means - magical or otherwise - will reappear
by fading into existence at midnight after a year and a day. Furthermore, once
the moongate has reformed, a curse will be placed on the creature responsible
and its companions; owl-folk will always be hostile to them, and they are more
likely to become feral werecreatures.

## Civilized folk

Most civilized folk live in cities, towns, and villages. There is a fairly high
chance settlements will have a good mix of all the civilized races if they're
not homogeneous for whatever reason (bigotry, practical reasons such as size,
climate, etc).

Civilized folk of all races tend to get along, though very homogeneous
communities, especially bigoted ones, are likely to distrust outsiders. The
lingua franca of civilized lands is called Common, and it's usually safe to
greet strangers in Common.

All civilized folk can interbreed. The child will be the same race as their
mother, and be born in the normal way as any child of their mother's race.

### Humans

Humans are mid-sized, bipedal, and have opposable thumbs. Their body hair is
thin, except on their head, face, and eyebrows, and can be black, brown, golden,
orange, grey, or white. Their eyes can be blue, grey, brown, green, or rarely
red, and their skin ranges in color from whitish to dark brown. Pregnant humans
give birth to one, or rarely two or rarer still three, babies after 9 months. A
human baby is full grown between 16 and 18, and in ideal conditions lives to the
age of 80.

Humans are the most numerous race, and are proud of their diversity and
heritage. Younger than the fey, and more technologically inclined, they have
built castles and cities across the lands.

Humans may speak a language native to the place they are from; the spread of
such a language depends on the place. They will also always speak Common unless
they are the most backwards, unintelligent people living in the middle of
nowhere.

Humans usually worship either the Pantheon or the Authority, but can often be
found worshipping other gods too.

### Kobolds

Kobolds are small, dragon-like reptile-folk that walk on their hind legs and use
their front claws (which have opposable thumbs) as humans do their hands.
Civilized kobolds are descended from the servants of metallic dragons, and thus
have scales colored shining gold, silver, bronze, copper, or brass. A kobold's
eyes can be any color except octarine. They reproduce sexually as do humans, but
give birth to eggs rather than live young. After 4 months of pregnancy, kobolds
give birth to clutches of 1d4 eggs, which hatch within weeks into juvenile
kobolds. A kobold child is full grown after four years, and in ideal conditions
lives to the age of about 55.

Despite the stereotype of them being stupid, they are just as intelligent and
capable as other civilized folk, and in fact are known to be clever when it
comes to mechanical devices and traps. This cleverness, combined with their
natural dexterity, means urban kobolds will often work as watch-makers,
jewellers, etc. Kobolds in civilization have a reputation for being loyal to
their "tribe" and brave when it comes to defending their home - many recruits to
the Watch will be kobolds, and kobolds will usually help watchmen or other
peace-keepers when they can.

Kobolds usually speak Common and always speak their own dialect of Draconic,
which is mutually intelligible with most other dialects of the language.

Kobolds worship either dragon-gods or, rarely, the Pantheon.

### Fey

Fey, or the Fair Folk, may look like humans at first blush, but look closer and
you'll see a certain oddness to their features; an angularity, uncanny symmetry,
or just plain alien-ness. Their ears also come to a point, being described as
"leaf-shaped" in some texts. Their eyes tend to be purple, but otherwise their
features will be similar to the local humans. They breed and give birth as do
humans, but become mature at 100 and are not known to die of old age, instead
fading back into nature after a few hundred years living in civilization.

They are descended from the spirits that dwell in nature - sprites, pixies,
nymphs etc - collectively known as fairies. As such, they are slightly magical
even if not actually magic-users. This heritage also leads to their aversion to
iron; they cannot use iron tools or weapons, and cannot enter a doorway
protected by iron unless invited.

The fey speak an ancient language from which Common is descended, but with which
it is not mutually intelligible.

The fey worship their own gods of nature. They are tolerated and respected by
followers of the Pantheon but mutually hated by followers of the Authority.

### Infernals

Infernals are of humanoid build, with either dusky red or ash-grey skin. They
have long, thin tails with an arrowhead tip, and wear their white hair long.
They have no body hair beneath the eyebrows and eyelashes. Their eyes are
purple, orange, red, or yellow. They may or may not have one or two fangs.
They give birth and live for roughly the same time as humans.

Descended from the servants of demons and devils, they can attack with their
arrowhead tails and ignite their eyes for a light source. Despite rumors to the
contrary, they are not fireproof. They face bigotry from human cities that
worship the Authority, but are tolerated or even accepted by the Pantheon. Many
great wizards and witches have been infernals.

Infernals do not sweat, but instead cool themselves by blowing steam from their
nostrils or igniting their eyes (which draws in heat from the rest of the body).

They have their own language, also called Infernal, and this is mutually
intelligible with most creatures of hell. Mind horrors also understand Infernal,
but their languages are unintelligible to infernals.

Infernals worship Devil Princes or Demon Lords, or rarely the Pantheon. They are
despised by followers of the Authority for their Devil/Demon worship and are
**extremely** unlikely ever to be accepted by that church, no matter their
piety.

### Dog-folk

Big and strong humanoids with dog- or wolf-like faces and thick fur, they are
the most numerous of the animal-folk due to their strong kinship with
humans. Dog-folk give birth after two months of pregnancy to 1d6 pups. Dog-folk
puppies are fully grown after three years, and will live to 60 in ideal
conditions.

Dog-folk have an impeccable sense of smell, giving them the ability to track any
creature they have the scent of. They can bark or howl extremely loud, which
tends to scare small creatures, kobolds, and cat-folk.

Much like kobolds, they are loyal and have a strong sense of community. Any
group of watchmen is likely to have dog-folk as members, even in homogeneous
human communities, as they are strong and their tracking skills make them good
investigators.

Humans love to pet dog-folk, and they tend to enjoy being petted - though it's
best to ask permission first, as they are sapient creatures and consent is
important. They do not see themselves as kin with animal wolves or dogs, so are
not offended by pet or working dogs.

Dog-folk speak a tonal language that can be communicated over long distances
using howls. They also always speak Common and usually the local human language.

Dog-folk worship as humans do.

### Cat-folk

Lithe, graceful humanoids with cat-like faces and soft fur, cat-folk are the
second-most numerous of the animal-folk. Their fur is either patchy or
solid-colored, and different cultures have valued one or the other at different
times. Having a patch shaped like a heart or somesuch is seen as highly
endearing.  Cat-folk give birth to kittens in a similar way as dog-folk, and
also live to about 60 in ideal conditions.

Cat-folk often think very highly of themselves, taking extra care grooming and
disliking manual labor. Lacking tools, they can groom themselves with their
tongues, but as a result may have to cough up furballs. They do not appreciate
hyena-folk's ribbing about licking themselves.

Cat-folk can see at night about as well as they can during the day. They despise
being immersed in water and will try to jump away from water if they end up in
it.

Cat-folk dislike dog-folk, much to the latter's confusion. They respect owl-folk
as fellow hunters and are wary of fox-folk. They often get on well with humans;
humans love to pet cat-folk, but they are always wary to ask for consent first.
Not asking for consent before petting a cat-folk will usually result in a
painful scratching.

Cat-folk speak their own language, which is elegant and flowing, as well as
Common. They may be too proud to learn much more than that.

Cat-folk are agnostic as a rule, except for Skalds, who may worship an
individualistic god from the Pantheon or a dragon-god.

### Hyena-folk

Hyena-folk are big, strong humanoids with faces resembling that of a hyena. They
are covered in thick, brownish-gold spotted fur and have dark eyes. They have
broad, strong shoulders and powerful legs. They breed and give birth similarly
to cat-folk and dog-folk, but live as long as humans due to their rigid
constitution.

Hyena-folk tend to be loud, brash, and gregarious. They enjoy jokes and banter,
and laugh a lot. They have a matriarchal culture only tempered by the more
egalitarian civilized folk. Straight hyena-folk women are often fascinated by
and attracted to human, kobold, and cat-folk men.

Hyena-folk can and will eat anything without getting sick, with the exception of
other civilized folk. As a result, they often smell bad to those not used to
their scent. The smell is bad enough that those with very sensitive noses, such
as dog-folk, may be able to detect hyena-folk sneaking up on them.

Whatever you do, do not refer to a hyena-folk as a gnoll. They strongly dislike
being associated with their distant, monstrous cousins and will take the
comparison as a grave insult.

They speak their own language which is full of wordplay and double-entendres, as
well as Common. They are often traders, and thus sometimes pick up third or
fourth languages for business.

Religiously they are similar to cat-folk.

### Owl-folk

Owl-folk are imposing humanoids with sharp beaks, all-seeing yellow eyes, and
downy brown, grey, and/or white feathers. When pregnant - in spring - they lay
eggs every so often over a period of 1d3 weeks, and incubated eggs hatch 30 days
after being laid. Owl-folk chicks are helpless for a few months, then become
children capable of speech, and reach full maturity after 13-15 years. Owl-folk
live for 75 years in ideal conditions.

Owl-folk legends state that they come from the moon, and they are often very
aware of moon phases and the positions and destinations of moongates. They feel
kinship with animal owls much more than other animal folk do, and see owlbears
as an abomination.

Owl-folk can turn their heads through 180', and often do this as a party trick
or to scout out an area behind them. They prefer hunting for their food, and as
they tend to cough up gross pellets after eating they prefer to do so alone.

Owl-folk make fantastic wizards, and have produced many famous and notable
wizards. They love reading, and will hoard books given half a chance. Urban
owl-folk will tend to be librarians, astrologers, or scribes.

Owl-folk speak their own language, which is clipped and brusque, and Common.
With concentration, a speaker of the Owl-folk language can understand the
Raven-folk language, and vice-versa.

Owl-folk worship the moon-gods, whose names are unknown even to them. They may
leave offerings of fresh kills or pounded rice-cakes during the full moon. Pious
owl-folk will discourage dog-folk from howling at the moon whenever they can.

### Raven-folk

Raven-folk are slightly short but stocky humanoids with sharp beaks and
inquisitive black eyes. They are covered in black feathers. They breed and give
birth similarly to how Owl-folk do, and also live to be about 75 in ideal
conditions.

They have a reputation for being sneaky and clever. Their mimicry of voices is
legendary, and they make excellent actors and musicians. Raven-folk Skalds often
give life to their poetry by mimicking the voices of their characters and
creating sound effects.

Rare is the Raven-folk who does not have a collection of shiny objects, many
useless. A Raven-folk's treasure hoard may contain actual valuables such as
coins, or it may contain discarded cutlery, broken mirrors, and metal foil. A
Raven-folk adventurer may even discard gemstones in favor of a shiny that caught
their eye! Urban Raven-folk with no talent for the performing arts may become
bankers or jewellers just for the ability to look at shinies all day.

Raven-folk speak their own language, of short words spoke with a croaking voice,
and Common. They can understand and be understood by speakers of the Owl-folk
language, so long as the listener concentrates carefully.

Raven-folk almost invariably worship Loki or the moon-gods. They will laugh at
proselytising from followers of the Authority.

### Fox-folk

Fox-folk are shifty-looking humanoids with red fur, thick fluffy tails with
white tips, and fox-like faces. They have inquisitive eyes. They breed similarly
to dog-folk and live for the same amount of time.

Known for being tricky and good at blending into darkness, Fox-folk revel in
their reputation for being bandits, thieves, and ne'er-do-wells. Respectable
urban Fox-folk often tend bars or work as merchants.

Bigotry against Fox-folk often centers around their compulsion to dig around in
garbage, which comes from having a big appetite and a lack of table manners.
Hyena-folk find this bigotry particularly distasteful and will aggressively
defend their Fox-folk friends against it.

Fox-folk speak their own language, which while not mutually intelligible with is
suspiciously similar to Thieves' Cant. They also speak Common. Many non-Fox-folk
merchants learn their language as it helps them to get better deals.

Fox-folk don't have a foot in any religious camp; they respect the moon-gods,
the dragon-gods, and the Pantheon, but aren't known for their piety. They still
fairly regularly produce decent Skalds, however.

## Calendar

The current calendar, used anywhere humans and/or fey live, marks years BDW
(before Dragon War) and ADW (after Dragon War). The Dragon War proper took place
in 0 ADW. The geopolitical situation described in the rest of this chapter is as
of around 500 ADW.

A year is 360 days, split into 12 months of 30 days each. A week is 6 days long.
Festivals/Feasts take place on the fifteenth of each month, except New Year's,
which occurs on the first day of the first month.

The months are:

Number | Name           | Season | Feast
-------|----------------|--------|-------
1      | Last Snows		| Winter | New Year's
2      | Blossoming		| Spring |
3      | Greenweeks		| Spring | Equinox
4      | Seed of Summer | Spring |
5      | Fire's Dawn	| Summer |
6      | Summerheart	| Summer | Solstice
7      | Summerwane		| Summer |
8      | Harvest		| Fall   | Harvest Festival
9      | All Hallow's	| Fall   | Equinox
10     | Sunfall		| Fall   |
11     | First Snows	| Winter |
12     | Winter's Heart | Winter | Solstice

The days of the week are, in order:

1. Moon Day
2. Tíw's Day
3. Odin's Day
4. Thor's Day
5. Freya's Day
6. Sun Day

The phases of the moon follow the month just about perfectly; a new moon heralds
the end of one month and the start of the next. The phases are, in order:

1. New Moon; the moon is almost completely dark or invisible
2. Waxing Crescent; the lit part of the moon is a crescent shape (less than
   half) on the right-side
3. First Quarter; the moon is half lit on the right-side
4. Waxing Gibbous; the moon is over half lit on the right-side
5. Full Moon; the moon is completely or almost completely lit
6. Waning Gibbous; the moon is over half lit on the left-side
7. Last Quarter; the moon is half lit on the left-side
8. Waning Crescent; the lit part of the moon is a crescent shape (less than
   half) on the left-side

The day of the week and the phase of the moon have a 1-1 mapping with the day of
the month, and can be found using this table:

Number | Day     | Phase
-------|---------|-----------
1      | Moon    | New Moon
2      | Tíw's   | New Moon
3      | Odin's  | Waxing Crescent
4      | Thor's  | Waxing Crescent
5      | Freya's | Waxing Crescent
6      | Sun	 | Waxing Crescent
7      | Moon	 | First Quarter
8      | Tíw's	 | First Quarter
9      | Odin's	 | First Quarter
10     | Thor's	 | First Quarter
11     | Freya's | Waxing Gibbous
12     | Sun	 | Waxing Gibbous
13     | Moon	 | Waxing Gibbous
14     | Tíw's	 | Waxing Gibbous
15     | Odin's	 | Full Moon
16     | Thor's	 | Full Moon
17     | Freya's | Waning Gibbous
18     | Sun	 | Waning Gibbous
19     | Moon	 | Waning Gibbous
20     | Tíw's	 | Waning Gibbous
21     | Odin's	 | Last Quarter
22     | Thor's	 | Last Quarter
23     | Freya's | Last Quarter
24     | Sun	 | Last Quarter
25     | Moon	 | Waning Crescent
26     | Tíw's	 | Waning Crescent
27     | Odin's	 | Waning Crescent
28     | Thor's	 | Waning Crescent
29     | Freya's | New Moon
30     | Sun	 | New Moon

A random day can be generated by rolling 1d12 for the month, and either of:

1. 1d30 for the day
2. 1d8 for the moon phase and 1d4 for the day of the phase

The Spring Equinox (3/15; Odin's Day in Greenweeks with a full moon in the sky)
or thereabouts is a good day to start a campaign, as this gives several months
of good weather for adventuring; the party won't have to worry about trudging
through snow or obtaining cold weather gear for some time.
