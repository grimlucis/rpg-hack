# Monsters

The world is a dark place. Sure, the civilized may have mapped out the lay of
the land, even named some of the dark corners where they dare not go, but there
is a reason they live in cities and hide behind walls.

Monsters are arranged into categories:

1. Monstrous Humanoids
2. Undead
3. Wild animals
4. Dungeon Creatures
5. Outsiders
6. Elementals
7. Dragons
8. Devils
9. Demons

Monster stat blocks are a lot simpler than character sheets. Instead of a HP
value, monsters get Hit Dice (HD); roll their HP as (HD)d8. This is roughly
equivalent to level. Defense may be given as a shorthand, e.g. "as leather".

Information is a little sparse on purpose; this is to immerse you (the GM) in
the OSR culture. Rules of thumb:

- The Attack value of monstrous creatures is 10+HD.
- The Save of a monstrous creature is 5+HD.
- Stats and bonuses are at the GM's discretion, usually 10+[Some bonus].

You may see a monster like this:

>Giant Clam, HD2+7, ...

This means that the Giant Clam is really tough (2d8+7 HP) but cannot attack that
well (fights as 2 HD).
