## Outsiders

As horrible as the creatures of our reality may be, there are creatures from
Beyond that we cannot fathom.

### Floating Eyes

- 11 HD
- Appearance: a floating sphere with a massive, evil eye, and ten eyestalks,
  whose gaping mouth is filled with rows of sharp teeth.
- Wants: Unknown
- Armor: Body as plate +4 (+10); Main eye as plate (+6); eyestalks as leather
  (+2)
- Move: Slow
- Morale: 12
- Damage: 2d8 bite; eye beams (special).

With ten horrible eyes on stalks surrounding a floating body with an eleventh,
massive eye, the Floating Eye is a fearsome Outsider from a higher plane of
existence. The creature is driven mad by its intersection into the material
plane, and unless it can be calmed down will attack on sight.

Its thick hide is near-impossible to damage with weaponry, but its primary eye
and eyestalks are weak spots.

All a Floating Eye's eyes can fire magic beams with a range of 120 feet. The
primary eye fires an anti-magic beam. The others fire:

1. A charm spell
2. A death ray
3. A disintegration beam
4. Magic missiles
5. A telekinetic beam
6. A petrifying ray
7. A fear spell
8. A sleep spell
9. A paralysis ray
10. A blinding ray

All except the magic missile spell can be used 1d6 times in an encounter; the
magic missile spell can be used once every three rounds.

A Floating Eye's native language is insane and unknowable; however, they also
speak Draconic, the Owl-folk's language, the Fey language, and the Infernal
language. They may be bargained with by adventurers that are willing to help
them to return to their home dimension, or to provide it with magical items.

### Mind Horrors

- 8+4 HD
- Appearance: Purplish-black of skin, a horrifying mass of tentacles for a head,
  this tall and fearsome humanoid reaches out its clawed hands and stares from
  unblinking dead-white eyes
- Wants: power, to devour the minds of the living
- Armor: as splintmail (+5)
- Move: Normal
- Morale: 10
- Damage: Weapon; 1d6 claw; devour mind; psionic blast

An intensely evil creature from the bowels of the earth, if not Hell itself, the
Mind Horror is of genius intelligence and its psionic powers are unmatched. To
gather more power it devours the minds of intelligent or wilful creatures, which
it does by burrowing into the opponent's skull with its horrifying tentacles.

If struck in the head by a tentacle, in 1d4 rounds the Mind Horror will shut
down all functionality in the victim's mind and split the skull open, ready to
devour the brain. This can be avoided by distracting the Mind Horror in some
such way that it releases its grip on its prey; powerful illusion magic, a
psionic or magical counterattack, or a simple blow with a melee weapon will do
this.

A Mind Horror can also attack with a blast of psionic energy. Enemies caught in
a 60' long cone in front of the Mind Horror must Save or be stunned for 3d4
rounds.

A pack of Mind Horrors are quite confident, but they will flee if the encounter
is going against them, being cowardly and trying to guard their own life.

The languages they speak are nameless and horrible, coming from the depths of
the earth where mankind dare not tread. If you're lucky (1-in-6) a Mind Horror
might speak Draconic, but all it'll have to say to you will be eagerness to
devour your mind.
