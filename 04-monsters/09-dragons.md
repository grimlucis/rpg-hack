## Dragons

Of all monsters, none are more feared and respected than the mighty dragons.

Dragons in these rules are treated specially; there's no one prototypical
"dragon" monster. Instead, dragons are classified by their appearance, strength,
and breath weapon. Stats are derived from the dragon's class (descending in
strength from 3) and its age category.

Dragons get three melee attacks: slashing with a claw, biting, and slamming with
a wing. If you sneak up from behind the dragon and it detects you, it can slam
you with its tail. This will do 2d6 * age category damage if the dragon is a
child or a wyrmling, and save or die if it's a juvenile or older.

1. Wyrmling - a recently hatched dragon. Between the size of a large dog and a
   horse. If you run into a dragon of this age, expect its adult or senior
   parents to be nearby.
2. Child - a very young dragon. Between the size of a horse and a house.
3. Juvenile - a young dragon, not yet full-grown but reaching sexual maturity.
   At this point most dragons will carve out territory and start to gather a
   hoard.
4. Adult - a full-grown dragon. By the time it's an adult, the dragon will have
   a sizable hoard, maybe a mate, possibly some magic abilities, and servants or
   allies.
5. Senior - a wise old adult dragon.  Its hoard will now be full of fantastic
   treasures and powerful magical items. If its mate is still alive, it will
   likely have many children by now. It is at this age that dragons may tire of
   hoarding and will pick up a "hobby", such as meddling in the affairs of the
   civilized, recording wisdom and deeds, or creating artifacts from the
   treasure they have gathered.
6. Old - a senior even among other seniors. Dragons of this age will probably
   have grandchildren. Metallic dragons of this age are sought out by wizards
   and lorekeepers for their wisdom.
7. Ancient - a dragon that has watched civilizations come and go. By this point,
   the dragon's name may be worked into legend. Any creative works by the dragon
   will be extremely valuable; craftdragonship will be of the highest quality.
8. Wyrm - the most powerful of dragons, excepting those that attain divinity. A
   legend even among dragons. There are few enough wyrms that all their names
   can be known; and even if one passes away, its name will live on in legends
   forever.
9. Divine - a dragon that has ascended through sorcery or heroic deeds. Easily
   the size of a great fortress when manifesting on the material plane, though
   it rarely does.

 Metallic | Primordial | Chromatic |Class| Breath Weapon
----------|------------|-----------|-----|--------------
 Gold     | Rose-Gold  | Red       |  3  | Fire
 Silver   | Storm      | Blue      |  2  | Lightning
 Bronze   | Forest     | Green     |  2  | Acid Gas
 Iron     | Winter     | White     |  1  | Frost
 Lead     | Night      | Black     |  1  | Venom

Dragons have the ability to take a humanoid form; they'll look either like a
strange human (and thus will be filed away as Fey or Infernal) or like a very
large kobold.

Killing a dragon is a two-staged process. Once the dragon's body is slain, its
heart must also be destroyed or neutralised, or it will return stronger and
angrier than before.

To destroy a dragon's heart, you can:

1. Drop it into the oceanic zone (blue water) of the coldest ocean.
2. Offer it as a sacrifice to a god more powerful than the dragon.
3. As a wizard or other magic user, eat it. This is difficult and disgusting,
   probably requiring several sessions of eating nothing but dragon heart, and
   cannot be done while adventuring or on the road.

If the dragon's heart is not destroyed, in the weeks following the dragon's
death, the dragonslayer will have nightmares in which the dragon taunts them and
mocks their hubris at believing they could destroy a dragon. A year and a day
after the dragon's supposed death, somewhere in the world a volcano will erupt,
and the dragon will be born anew, ranked up an age category, with knowledge of
who killed them the first time and their current whereabouts...

### Metallic Dragons

Metallic dragons are very rarely encountered. A small handful still live in the
lairs of their ancestors, and a smaller number still take humanoid form and live
among humans, Fey, or kobolds. Their society is underground and secretive.

In general, metallic dragons are "good" dragons. Evil characters who survive the
watch, the local lord's manhunters, or his liege lord's professional assassins
can expect metallic dragons to start to take interest in bringing them down.

Metallic dragons always speak Draconic, and an extra language per age category.

- **Gold Dragons** are the kings of metallic dragons. Their shimmering gold
  scales are beautiful and admired by dragons and non-dragons alike. Culturally
  they value justice, integrity, and strength of moral character.
- **Silver Dragons** live in mountainous caves. They take great pride in their
  swiftness of flight. A gleam of silver in the sky may be your first and only
  warning that a silver dragon approaches.
- **Bronze Dragons** are mischievous and silly. They value freedom above all
  and were the first to free their kobold servants, leading bronze-coloured
  kobolds to be the most numerous. A dragon in humanoid form is most likely to
  be bronze. Bronze dragons have lovely brownish-red scales which they polish to
  become a gleaming reflective surface.
- **Iron Dragons** are noble, but haughty. It is said that in ancient times, the
  raven-folk used to ride iron dragons into battle. Being the sign of advancing
  winter, cold dragons of all types - including their cousins the white dragons
  and their ancestors the winter dragons - are shunned by Fey and rarely appear
  in forests. An iron dragon's scales are cold silver in color and somewhat
  reflective.
- **Lead Dragons** are very rare even among metallic dragons. They are
  lorekeepers and storytellers. Placating a lead dragon will often involve the
  gift of a scroll, book, or tapestry. Lead dragons inhabit giant underground
  libraries, built and staffed by loyal leaden kobolds. Lead dragons have
  blackish-grey scales that do not shine.

### Chromatic Dragons

Chromatic dragons are the most numerous and most often encountered. They make
their lairs in the various dark and dangerous corners of the world.

Chromatic dragons are the corrupt half of their primordial ancestors. While once
they were civilized and intelligent like their metallic cousins, these days they
are mostly savage and bestial.

For each age category a chromatic dragon attains, there is a 2-in-6 chance it
will learn a language. The first such time, the language will be Draconic, after
which it will be some other language.

- **Red Dragons** are massive beacons of flame and destruction. Their blood-red
  scales are feared by all sane and most insane creatures. They despise and feud
  with gold dragons. They are ill-tempered and quick to anger, and can rarely be
  reasoned with.
- **Blue Dragons** are proud of their strength. They do not back down from a
  fight, even if outnumbered or outgunned. They are territorial and more likely
  to attack. Their scales are a beautiful azure, and they're very proud of them.
  You can do worse than complimenting a blue dragon's scales and bringing it a
  gift of sapphires to placate or even befriend it.
- **Green Dragons** are intelligent schemers. They like to sow discord in
  civilization. They have been known to parley with Fey communes, who share
  their love of mischief and chaos. Their grass-green scales blend well with
  their forest habitat.
- **White Dragons** are cowardly and genuflect to stronger creatures. They hide
  in snow, where they are camouflaged by their ice-white scales. They can be
  vengeful of those that wrong them, even more than other chromatics.
- **Black Dragons** are cruel brutes that dwell in swamps. Their matte-black
  scales let them lurk in the night until unfortunate travellers stray past,
  when the dragon will ambush. If a black dragon is killed, its poisonous blood
  will seep into the earth, and nothing edible will grow there for a year and a
  day.

### Primordial Dragons

The ancient ancestors of the metallic and chromatic dragons, created by the
first gods when the planet was forged from chaos, primordial dragons are now
mostly extinct. The few that remain will be powerful and ancient wyrms, or even
outright dragon-gods.

They were egotistic, but also noble; prideful, but also wise. Much like the
civilized races they begot or watched evolve, primordial dragons were as varied
and as nuanced as the world itself.

- **Rose-Gold Dragons** were the first dragons; the strongest and wisest. They
  used their fire breathing to build subterranean dragon cities, some of which
  still exist today. Their name comes from the rose-gold color of their scales,
  which was said to be the wonder of the natural world.
- **Storm Dragons** were the most primordial of the primordial dragons. They
  were created by the gods to battle the elementals; their breath weapon
  electrified Water, their gathering storms quelled Fire, their mastery of the
  sky tempered Earth, and they were able to weather anything the Air could throw
  at them. They had silvery-blue scales.
- **Forest Dragons** were ancient guardians of nature; tales of their deeds
  survive in ancient Fey poetry. They had leaf-shaped scales that followed the
  seasons - green in spring and summer, amber in fall, and grey in winter.
- **Winter Dragons** used to signal the coming of the frost, the first snows,
  and the passage of time into winter. Their scales were a silvery off-white.
- **Night Dragons** prowled the ancient skies once the sun set. It is said that
  a night dragon was the first to make contact with the moon gods and their
  servants the Owl-folk. Their scales were a hauntingly beautiful midnight blue.
