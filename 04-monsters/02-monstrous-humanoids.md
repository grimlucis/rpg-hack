## Monstrous Humanoids

Some might say the real monster is within. They haven't met these lovely folks.

### Kobolds

- ½ HD (Fight as 1 HD; 1d4 HP) (Chieftain: 2 HD)
- Appearance: short, draconic folk with makeshift armor and weaponry
- Wants: treasure, to protect the pack
- Armor: as leather (+2)
- Move: normal
- Morale: 6, or 8 if the chieftain is alive and with them
- Damage: 1d6 weapon or 1d4 claws/teeth/tail

Outside of the bounds of civilization, some kobolds still live a monstrous
lifestyle. Civilized kobolds are typically descended from the servants of
benevolent metallic dragons, whereas their monstrous cousins worship vicious
chromatic dragons or horrific draconic Old Gods.

At the heart of a kobold lair is a chieftain, who fights as a 2 HD monster and
has 9 HP. His bodyguards (1d6 of them) have 6 HP and fight as 1+1 HD monsters.
Kobolds who are with their chieftain fight bravely, but if he is killed they
will probably scatter rather than fight on to avenge him.

Kobolds fight in packs. An individual kobold in an environment he doesn't know
isn't much of a threat, but smart kobolds band together, build traps, and lure
unsuspecting adventurers to their demise.

### Goblins

- 1-1 HD (King: 3 HD)
- Appearance: ugly, stinking, earthy-colored miniature humanoids.
- Wants: gold, to cause chaos
- Armor: as leather (+2)
- Move: normal
- Morale: 7, or 9 if the king is alive and with them
- Damage: 1d6 or 1d6-1 teeth

Hated and feared in the civilized world, these creatures can never understand
any morality beyond might-makes-right. They see anything shiny as theirs by
right of conquest. They are also highly mischievous, delighting in causing chaos
for civilized folk.

At the heart of a goblin tribe's lair is a goblin king, who has 15 HP and fights
as a 3 HD monster; he gets a +1 to damage. He has 2d6 bodyguards who fight as 2
HD monsters and have 2d6 HP each.

With the exception of the king and his bodyguards, goblins fight with a penalty
of -1 to Attack in daylight.

### Hobgoblins

- 1+1 HD (King: 5 HD)
- Appearance: ugly, stinking, earthy-colored humanoids.
- Wants: gold, chaos, to boss around smaller creatures
- Armor: as chainmail (+4)
- Move: Normal
- Morale: 8, or 10 if the king is alive and with them
- Damage: 1d8 or by weapon

Hobgoblins are the bigger and meaner cousins of goblins. They may keep goblins
as slaves or followers. They're no smarter or more civilized than goblins, and
are thus hated just as much.

At the heart of a hobgoblin tribe's lair is a hobgoblin king, who has 22 HP and
fights as a 5 HD monster; he gets a +2 to damage. He has 1d4 bodyguards who
fight as 4 HD monsters and have 3d6 HP each.

Hobgoblins suffer no penalties for fighting in daylight, though they still
prefer to live underground.

### Gnolls

- 2 HD (Leader: 3 HD)
- Appearance: large humanoids with a vicious hyena-like appearance.
- Wants: to make a living by bullying and stealing
- Armor: as chainmail (+4)
- Move: Normal
- Morale: 8
- Damage: 2d4 or by weapon + 1

Gnolls are distant and savage cousins of hyena-folk, though don't remind them of
that; calling a hyena-folk a "gnoll" is a grave insult likely to end in a fight.
They typically hunt in packs to steal gold, food and equipment. They use gold
and other spoils to occasionally trade with humanoids of poor moral character,
such as other monstrous humanoids, necromancers, and raiders.

For every 20 gnolls there will be a leader with 16 HP who attacks as a 3 HD
monster.

### Sea Devils

- 2+2 HD
- Appearance: somewhere between a fish and a reptile, with webbed feet and
  vicious claws
- Wants: destruction of surface-dwellers
- Armor: as chainmail (+4)
- Move: ½ on land; 2 times in water
- Morale: 10
- Damage: 1d6+2 trident or spear; 1d6 bite/claw

Feared creatures of the sea, Sea Devils are rarely seen more than a mile or two
inland, as they can only breathe above water for about four hours. When they
emerge, they are terrifying - screaming in their language that land-dwelling
creatures cannot comprehend, they gnash their teeth and brandish barbed and
serrated spears. In this form they are usually seen raiding seaside
villages. They hate surface-dwellers with a passion that cannot be understated.

Praying to a devil-shark god of the depths, they are heartless and cruel; the
death of one usually means a meal for his companions. If encountered underwater,
beware - they often herd sharks as attack dogs.

They have a special hatred for magic and magic-users, so beware if you cast a
spell in the presence of a Sea Devil pack, as they may focus on you. This extends
especially to the Fey, whom they hate most of all and will attack on sight.

### Mind Horrors

- 8+4 HD
- Appearance: Purplish-black of skin, a horrifying mass of tentacles for a head,
  this tall and fearsome humanoid reaches out its clawed hands and stares from
  unblinking dead-white eyes
- Wants: power, to devour the minds of the living
- Armor: as splintmail (+5)
- Move: Normal
- Morale: 10
- Damage: Weapon; 1d6 claw; devour mind; psionic blast

An intensely evil creature from the bowels of the earth, if not Hell itself, the
Mind Horror is of genius intelligence and its psionic powers are unmatched. To
gather more power it devours the minds of intelligent or wilful creatures, which
it does by burrowing into the opponent's skull with its horrifying tentacles.

If struck in the head by a tentacle, in 1d4 rounds the Mind Horror will shut
down all functionality in the victim's mind and split the skull open, ready to
devour the brain. This can be avoided by distracting the Mind Horror in some
such way that it releases its grip on its prey; powerful illusion magic, a
psionic or magical counterattack, or a simple blow with a melee weapon will do
this.

A Mind Horror can also attack with a blast of psionic energy. Enemies caught in
a 60' long cone in front of the Mind Horror must Save or be stunned for 3d4
rounds.

A pack of Mind Horrors are quite confident, but they will flee if the encounter
is going against them, being cowardly and trying to guard their own life.

The languages they speak are nameless and horrible, coming from the depths of
the earth where mankind dare not tread. If you're lucky (1-in-6) a Mind Horror
might speak Draconic, but all it'll have to say to you will be eagerness to
devour your mind.
