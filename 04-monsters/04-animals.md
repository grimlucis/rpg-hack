## Wild Animals

In the wilderness, one might run into mundane animals as well as monstrous
creatures.

Wild animals are primarily motivated by food, safety, or territory. They can
usually be scared off by fire or something bigger than them, so long as they
aren't cornered.

### Wolves

- 2+2 HD
- Appearance: Large canines with pointed ears and shaggy coats
- Armor: as leather (+2)
- Move: Fast
- Morale: 8
- Damage: 1d6 bite

The wild cousins of the domesticated dog, wolves travel in packs, howl at the
moon, and can be highly territorial. Wolves may see dog-folk as encroaching on
their territory, but they can be placated by a tribute or sign of submission.
They may be able to understand simple information from a dog-folk's howl.

Much like dogs, wolves are somewhat intelligent and are wary of humanoids,
especially armed men like adventurers. If encountering a wolf pack, they're
unlikely to be hostile (+2 to reaction) unless starving or considering the party
as encroaching on their territory.

#### Direwolves

- 4+1 HD
- Appearance: Large, slobbering canines with vicious fangs
- Armor: as studded (+3)
- Move: Very fast
- Morale: 8
- Damage: 2d4 bite

Larger and more aggressive than their mundane wolf counterparts, direwolves are
only seen in the depths of the wilderness. They may be the leaders of a pack of
wolves, or appear as a direwolf pack.

They are stronger than wolves and much more territorial. They've also been known
to attack villages or monstrous settlements in packs when hungry. Some
particularly brave monstrous humanoids, such as kobolds or goblins, have been
known to tame direwolves and even to use them as mounts.

#### White Wolves

- 6 HD
- Appearance: Pale white canines with ice-blue eyes and almost vampiric fangs
- Armor: as chain (+4)
- Move: Very fast
- Morale: 10
- Damage: 2d4 bite; 6d4 breath weapon (ice; save for Â½)

Appearing in lands of magic perma-winter, White Wolves are larger and nastier
even than direwolves. Not much is known about them, since only the bravest
adventurers survive an encounter with a pack; but it is known that they have
frost breath and are immune to cold.

White Wolves cannot be domesticated except by ice giants, elementals, and other
creatures of magic winter; ice giants may use them to herd woolly mammoths.

### Elephants & Woolly Mammoths

- 9 HD
- Appearance: Grey quadrupeds with long trunks and large floppy ears
- Armor: as chain (+4)
- Move: Normal
- Morale: 8 (10)
- Damage: 1 or 2 2d4 tusks; 4d8 trample

Gigantic herbivores native to the savannah, desert, marsh and jungle, elephants
travel in herds, foraging for food. They are important for their habitat,
digging waterholes in times of drought and helping to spread seeds.

Elephants are intelligent creatures. They can use simple tools using their
trunks, and can solve simple puzzles. Humanoids have long-standing relations
with elephants, using them as working animals, mounts, and for warfare. A war
elephant has 10 morale instead of 8, and its rider is raised out of the reach of
most melee weapons; it will also try to enact revenge on any creature that kills
its rider.

Elephant tusks are a treasure alike in value to semi-precious gems; poaching of
elephants can be a serious problem in some regions.

Elephants get +4 to-hit to trample creatures smaller than a human.

A woolly mammoth is an arctic variety of elephant, which has 10 morale and +2 to
armor and HD.

### Bears

- 4 HD
- Appearance: Thick-furred animals with sharp claws and teeth
- Armor: as studded (+3)
- Move: Slow
- Morale: 8 (10)
- Damage: 2 1d4 claws (+2d6 bearhug); 1d8 bite

A female bear with young is much more aggressive and territorial, attacking
anything it sees as a threat to its young on site, and fighting at 10 rather
than 8 morale.

If both of its claws hit a creature, it will grasp them in a bearhug for an
extra 2d6 damage.

Cave bears are bigger and stronger, and dwell in deep caves and dungeons; they
have 6 HD and all their damage rolls (except the bearhug) are stepped up two
dice sizes.

#### Owl Bears

- 5 HD
- Appearance: The bulky body of a bear, with the ferocious face of an owl
- Armor: as chain (+4)
- Move: Normal
- Morale: 7
- Damage: 2 1d8 claws (+2d8 bearhug); 1d8 bite (beak)

Hideous fusions of owls and bears, these land-based creatures are found in the
wilderness. They are motivated mostly by hunger, trying to find meat to eat;
they aren't scared of people in armor, as they can use their claws to open them
up for a tasty morsel. However, they're a bit cowardly compared to other
monsters and will flee if they face someone who can fight back.

Owl-folk see owl bears as a hideous abomination; even wilderness areas inhabited
by owl-folk are usually cleared of the creatures by hunting parties. Owl bears
encountered in such territories may also be stalked by 1d4+3 owl-folk rangers at
level 2 or higher, who will gladly aid any adventurers in slaying the owl bear.

An owl bear's bearhug will do 2d8 damage, as it is stronger than a true bear.
