## Conversion between GLOG and other systems

### Armor class/Defense

Conversion between GLOG/Ascending, certain editions of the world's first
roleplaying game, and Whitehack.

 GLOG | Desc1 | Desc2 | WH |  5E  | Example
------|-------|-------|----|------|---------------
  10  |    9  |   10  | 0  |  10  | Unarmored
  11  |    8  |    9  | 1  |  11  | Cloth/Gambeson
  12  |    7  |    8  | 2  |  12  | Leather
  13  |    6  |    7  | 3  |  13  | Studded
  14  |    5  |    6  | 4  |  16  | Chainmail
  15  |    4  |    5  | 5  |  17  | Splintmail
  16  |    3  |    4  | 6  |  18  | Full plate
  17  |    2  |    3  | 7  | (19) |
  18  |    1  |    2  | 8  | (20) |
  19  |    0  |    1  | 9  | (21) |
  20  |   -1  |    0  | 10 | (22) |
  21  |   -2  |   -1  | 11 | (23) |
  22  |   -3  |   -2  | 12 | (24) |
  23  |   -4  |   -3  | 13 |  25  | Tarrasque
  24  |   -5  |   -4  | 14 | (26) |
  25  |   -6  |   -5  | 15 | (27) |
  26  |   -7  |   -6  | 16 | (28) |
  27  |   -8  |   -7  | 17 | (29) |
  28  |   -9  |   -8  | 18 | (30) |

Notes:

- Use Desc1 for BECMI, B/X, and 0E.
- Use Desc2 for advanced editions.
- Items in parenthesis are not supported by evidence, but are an educated guess.
- 5E AC values are roughly equivalent to GLOG for lighter armor, but quickly
  balloon. You can probably use them as-is for most enemies, but cross-reference
  to be sure.
- 3E AC values are ridiculously buffed, certainly for strong creatures such as
  dragons. The 5E conversion guide recommends nerfing it by 20%, which seems
  adequate. You can then use the 5E table to convert to OSR.

### Attributes

Where other games have Intelligence (INT) and Wisdom (WIS), the GLOG has Talent
(TAL) and Willpower (WIL), respectively.  Treat them as the same apart from the
name.

The GLOG does not have a Constitution (CON) attribute. The duties of the CON
attribute in other games are performed by the STR attribute. When converting a
character from the GLOG to another system, their CON score is the same as their
STR score. When converting from another system to the GLOG, the character's STR
score is, at the GM's discretion, either:

- The average of STR and CON, i.e. (STR+CON)/2
- The higher of STR or CON

### Class conversion

In general, the classes given are categorised as to line up with the classic
Fighter/Mage/Cleric/Thief schtick, and can be converted as such.

Specifically:

- Veterans are Fighters
- Barbarians are either Fighters or Barbarians
- Wizards of the various schools can be converted to Magic-Users with an
  appropriate selection of spells
- Skalds are Clerics that use CHA instead of WIS/WIL
- Missionaries are either Monks or Clerics
- Jacks are Thieves/Rogues
- Bards are either straight Bards, Magic-Users with appropriate spells that cast
  by singing and with CHA instead of INT/TAL, or Thieves/Rogues

When converting to Whitehack, keep the way the character is played in mind when
converting; of course, the Deft/Strong/Wise trio maps quite nicely onto
Thief/Fighter/Mage.

### Race conversion

When converting from the GLOG to another system:

- Humans convert as-is; other games have reasons to pick them
- Fey can be treated as elves
- If available, Infernals can be treated as tieflings or half-elves; otherwise,
  as elves
- Kobolds can be treated as halflings or gnomes with Draconic as their racial
  language
- Cat-folk, Raven-folk, Fox-folk and Owl-folk can be treated as humans with
  special attributes
- Dog-folk and Hyena-folk can be treated as half-orcs

When converting to the GLOG from another system, keep in mind Andrew K's
philosophy on designing races:

- GLOG Design Rule #48: Race abilities/bonuses should not synergize with class
  abilities/bonuses.
- GLOG Design Rule #3: Never use small, passive bonuses.  They're boring, easy
  to overlook, potentially confusing, and often lead to synergy.  Use active
  abilities instead.  (What Extra Credits calls "incomparables".)

Here's a quick table of "classic" races not included in the base rules, courtesy
of Throne of Salt:

Race    | Reroll | Perk                                  | Drawback
--------|--------|---------------------------------------|---------
Elf     | DEX    |+2 to Stealth in natural cover         | Terrified of ugly things
Dwarf   | STR    |Can identify origin of worked items    | No booze = exhaustion
Half-orc| STR    |Extra attack after drawing first blood | Cursed by the orc gods
Half-elf| CHA    |+2 to Save vs magic                    | Hated by domestic animals
Halfling| DEX    |Lucky: rerolls a 1, 1/day				 | Save vs lost in cities
Gnome   | TAL    |+2 to understand, repair, and build mechanical devices | Enemies may choose to punt
