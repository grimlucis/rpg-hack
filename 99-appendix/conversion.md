## Conversion between GLOG and other systems

### Armor class/Defense

Conversion between GLOG/Ascending, certain editions of the world's first
roleplaying game, and Whitehack.

 GLOG | Desc1 | Desc2 | WH |  5E  | Example

  10  |    9  |   10  | 0  |  10  | Unarmored
  11  |    8  |    9  | 1  |  11  | Cloth/Gambeson
  12  |    7  |    8  | 2  |  12  | Leather
  13  |    6  |    7  | 3  |  13  | Studded
  14  |    5  |    6  | 4  |  16  | Chainmail
  15  |    4  |    5  | 5  |  17  | Splintmail
  16  |    3  |    4  | 6  |  18  | Full plate
  17  |    2  |    3  | 7  | (19) |
  18  |    1  |    2  | 8  | (20) |
  19  |    0  |    1  | 9  | (21) |
  20  |   -1  |    0  | 10 | (22) |
  21  |   -2  |   -1  | 11 | (23) |
  22  |   -3  |   -2  | 12 | (24) |
  23  |   -4  |   -3  | 13 |  25  | Tarrasque
  24  |   -5  |   -4  | 14 | (26) |
  25  |   -6  |   -5  | 15 | (27) |
  26  |   -7  |   -6  | 16 | (28) |
  27  |   -8  |   -7  | 17 | (29) |
  28  |   -9  |   -8  | 18 | (30) |

Notes:

- Use Desc1 for BECMI, B/X, and 0E.
- Use Desc2 for advanced editions.
- Items in parenthesis are not supported by evidence, but are an educated guess.
- 5E AC values are roughly equivalent to GLOG for lighter armor, but quickly
  balloon. You can probably use them as-is for most enemies, but cross-reference
  to be sure.
- 3E AC values are ridiculously buffed, certainly for strong creatures such as
  dragons. The 5E conversion guide recommends nerfing it by 20%, which seems
  adequate. You can then use the 5E table to convert to OSR.

### Attributes

Where other games have Intelligence (INT) and Wisdom (WIS), the GLOG has Talent
(TAL) and Willpower (WIL), respectively.  Treat them as the same apart from the
name.

The GLOG does not have a Constitution (CON) attribute. The duties of the CON
attribute in other games are performed by the STR attribute. When converting a
character from the GLOG to another system, their CON score is the same as their
STR score. When converting from another system to the GLOG, the character's STR
score is, at the GM's discretion, either:

- The average of STR and CON, i.e. (STR+CON)/2
- The higher of STR or CON
