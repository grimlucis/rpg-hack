## Playing GLOG with d6s only

Six-sided dice are the most common dice, and are easily obtained. So, it makes
sense that rules should exist for playing with only d6s. The distributions are
skewed, but the game can still be played.

1d4 | 1d6, reroll on 5 or 6
1d8 | 1d6+1
1d10| 2d6, reroll on 11 or 12
1d12| 2d6
1d20| 1) 3d6 2) 4d6-3, reroll on 21 3) 1d10 + flip a coin add 10 on heads/roll a die add 10 on evens
