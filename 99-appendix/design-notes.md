## Design notes

I deliberately did not include skills. In my opinion, skill checks are
superfluous in a class-based system (a barbarian should obviously have tracking
and bushcraft; a wizard should obviously have arcana, etc) and are far too
metagamey anyways (who picks knitting? Everyone's going to pick dungeoneering
and survival). If you want to do a skill check, just check against the relevant
equipment, giving a small (1-2) bonus or penalty based on background & class if
applicable. Better still, just automatically succeed or fail based on same.
