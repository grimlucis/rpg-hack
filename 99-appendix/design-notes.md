## Design notes

I deliberately did not include skills. In my opinion, skill checks are
superfluous in a class-based system (a barbarian should obviously have tracking
and bushcraft; a wizard should obviously have arcana, etc) and are far too
metagamey anyways (who picks knitting? Everyone's going to pick dungeoneering
and survival). If you want to do a skill check, just check against the relevant
equipment, giving a small (1-2) bonus or penalty based on background & class if
applicable. Better still, just automatically succeed or fail based on same.

The constitution (CON) attribute is not included. I feel it doesn't do enough to
distance itself from STR to be useful, and it can easily create incoherent
characters (what does a character with 18 STR but 3 CON look like?). A fighter
basically *needs* both a good CON and a good STR to succeed, because they need
both the health bonus and their prime attribute. So I've just merged it into
STR - if you get a good STR score, that makes you a good fighter, so there's no
need to weigh CON up against STR when rolling up a fighter.
