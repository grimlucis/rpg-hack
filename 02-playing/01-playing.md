# Playing the game

Tell the GM what your character does, and the GM will tell you what happened.
The rest is just book-keeping.

## Basic mechanics

Nearly everything uses a d20 rolled against a target number.  If you roll equal
or less, you succeed.  For example, if you have a Strength of 9, you have a 45%
chance to succeed on a Strength check.  Bonuses and penalties are usually +/- 2
or 4.

Contested checks are likewise resolved with a single roll.  The player makes
their check with a bonus or penalty proportionate to how far the opponent's stat
is from 10.  Examples:

**Shoving**: The PC has Str 11, the orc has Str 14.  The PC needs to roll a 7 or
less to succeed, since 11 – 4 = 7.

**Attacking**: The PC has Attack 12, the orc has Defense 16 (plate). The PC
needs to roll a 6 or less to succeed, since 12 – 6 = 6.  If they were attacking
an ooze with Defense 8, they would need to roll a 14 or less to succeed.

Critical successes occur on a 20 or a 1, at the GM's discretion, and vice-versa
for critical misses. The choice mostly comes down to whether the GM prefers the
classic aesthetics of a "NATURAL TWENTY!" or the logical consistency of
low-numbers-are-better. For the sake of simplicity, the rules here will assume a
1 is a critical hit, a 20 a critical miss.

### Stealth

Your Stealth is equal to 5 + Dex bonus - Encumbrance.  You roll Stealth whenever
you tryto sneak up on someone, or past someone.  Stealth only applies when
success is ambiguous.  Anyone can hide under a bed, and no one can walk in front
of an alert guard without being seen.

A party attempting to be Stealthy uses the Stealth score of the least Stealthy
member.

### Move

Your Movement is equal to 12 + Dex bonus – Encumbrance.  This is the same as
Movement Speed in previous editions.  You roll it when climbing, jumping,
balancing,and running.  It is also used for chases.

A party moves at the speed of its slowest character.

### Initiative

Your Initiative is equal to your Willpower.  You roll it at the beginning of
each combat round.  If you succeed, you act before the enemies.  If you fail,
you act after them.

### Save

Your Save is equal to 5 + level + Cha bonus (because Charisma describes
willpower and destiny) up to a max of 15 + Cha bonus.  You roll it to test your
fate: which basically boils down toresisting magic and getting lucky

## Inventory

If you have a backpack or satchel, you have a number of inventory slots equal to
your STR + 2. Most items take up one Inventory Slot. Two-handed weapons take up
two. Armor takes a number of slots equal to its Defense bonus - i.e. subtract
\10. Negligible items (small enough to put inside your closed mouth) take up
none. Coins and gems never take up Inventory Slots.

You gain 1 point of Encumbrance for every Inventory Slot in excess of your
capacity.

In addition to getting Encumbered from carrying too much, you can also gain
Encumbrance from wearing armor.  Each point of an armor's Defense bonus in
excess of +3 incurs a point of Encumbrance.

Encumbrance is applied as a penalty to your Movement, Stealth, and Dex checks.
(It doesn't actually decrease your Dex, it just makes any Dex checks more
difficult.)

### Starting Equipment

You start with:

1. Blanket (1 slot)
2. Waterskin (1 slot)
3. Rations  x3 (1 slot)
4. Flint and Tinder (0 slots)
5. 2 copper coins in a coin pouch
6. A random item

## Combat

In the GLOG, much like the world's oldest roleplaying tradition from which it
draws inspiration, combat is fast and deadly. If you're a wizard, best leave it
to your stronger companions and hirelings. If you're a fighting type - this is
your zone. Learn it, and learn it well.

### Combat Order

Once every creature in combat gets to act, a *round* has passed. This takes just
a few seconds in game-time - between a second and a minute, based on the GM's
discretion.

1. Roll your initiative as described as above.
2. Either before or after the monsters act, each player makes their turn, lowest
   roll first.
3. On your turn you can:
   - Attack, or do something that requires full concentration
   - Advance or retreat
   - Talk as much as you like out-of-character; talk a reasonable amount
	 in-character (barking orders, warning your comrades, battle-cries, etc).

### Attack

You roll Attack whenever you try to hit something.  A first-level Adventurer has
an Attack of 11.  Your target's Defense is applied as a penalty to this roll.

#### Damage

If you hit, roll for damage.

##### Melee Weapons

Light weapons like daggers take up a single inventory slot and deal 1d6 damage.
They can be thrown (-1 Attack for every 10' beyond the first) and suffer no
penalties when fighting in a confined space.

Medium weapons like swords take up a single Inventory Slot and deal 1d6+[STR
bonus] damage, or 1d8+[STR bonus] damage if wielded with two hands.

Heavy weapons like greatswords take up two Inventory Slots and deal 1d10+[STR
bonus] damage, and must be wielded with two hands.

##### Ranged Weapons

Slings deal 1d6+[STR bonus] damage.  They get -1 Attack for every 20' beyond the
first.  A sling can share an Inventory Slot with up to 3 stones.  Stones can
always be gathered with a few minutes of searching.

Bows deal 1d8+[STR bonus] damage and get -1 Attack for every 30' beyond the
first.

Crossbows deal 1d12 damage and get -1 Attack for every 40' beyond the first.  It
requires a standard action to reload a crossbow.

Both bows and crossbows shoot arrows.  You can fit 20 arrows in an Inventory
Slot.  If you recover spent arrows after combat, 50% of them will be usable.

Possession of a crossbow is usually a crime, outside of being a soldier in times
of war, or possibly a veteran of considerable skill with one. They are
knight-killing weapons.

#### Breakage

If you make an Attack or Defense roll which is *almost* a critical miss (a
natural 19) you risk breaking your weapon or armor. The chance it breaks depends
on its quality:

- Fragile weapons, for example improvised weapons or the bronze weaponry the Fey
  use, always break.
- Standard weapons have a 50% chance of breaking.
- Masterwork weapons have a 1-in-6 chance of breaking.

When a weapon gets its first break, it gets -1 to Attack.  When it gets its
second break, it snaps in half.

Every time armor gets a break, it gets -1 to Defense.  It doesn't snap in half
until the penalty equals the bonus (or 4 breaks on chainmail). You can mark
breakages with tally marks next to the armor on your character sheet.

### Defense

You roll Defense whenever an opponent tries to hit you, with a penalty derived
from your opponent's Attack.  It is modified by Dexterity.

   Armor          | Weight | Defense value
------------------|--------|--------------
Gambeson (Padded) | Light  |      11
Rawhide (Leather) | Light  |      12
Lamellar (Studded)| Light  |      13
Chainmail         | Medium |      14
Splintmail        | Heavy  |      15
Plate             | Heavy  |      16

Chainmail cannot be made from bronze, and bronze heavy armor has a -1 to
Defense.

Shields grant +1 Defense. Additionally, you can choose to sunder your shield to
reduce incoming physical damage by 1d12 points.

Spellcasters cannot cast spells while wearing armor, but clerics can pray while
wearing it.

### Hit Points

Your Hit Points (HP) are maybe better thought of as "Don't Get Hit" Points. They
represent a combination of your luck, the hard-won results of your training, and
your natural bulk and ability to survive. Being reduced to 0 HP is bad, but not
fatal in and of itself. It's damage past 1 HP that you have to worry about.
Damage in excess of 0 HP incurs a roll on the dreaded Death and Dismemberment
Table, found in chapter 3.

#### Recovering Hit Points

There are three ways to recover your hit points:

- A good night's rest restores all HP, assuming you have a blanket and a
  campfire.  Otherwise, it only heals 1d6+level HP.
- A good long lunch restores 1d6+level HP, as long as you have food and water.
  The whole affair takes an hour.
- Magical healing can restore your HP.

### Injuries, Insanity, Trauma, Doubt

Injuries are one of the consequences of rolling on the Death and Dismemberment
Table.  They have a fixed duration.  For example, “Sprained Ankle, 4days” means
that you will be moving at half speed for the next 4 days.

Whenever you receive magical healing, you heal HP, but you also heal an injury,
shortening it's duration by an equal amount of days.  Magical healing cannot
reduce an injury's remaining duration to less than 1 day, because there's no
substitute for a good night's sleep.

Trauma is an optional subsystem detailed in the Death and Dismemberment section.
Basically, seeing/doing traumatic things incurs Trauma Points, and gaining
enough of those risks temporary and permanent insanity.

Doubt reflects your character's resolve to continue, and is another optional
subsystem.  Some creatures, like angels, attack your resolve instead of your hit
points.  Basically, you have a hidden HP pool called Resolve, calculated the
same way HP is, except substituting CHA for STR. When it runs out, you either
become an unfriendly NPC, or you replace one of your Convictions.

## Spellcasting

Spells are creatures. Angels, demons, spells, enchantments, ghosts, and souls
are all more or less the same. Most spells are about as intelligent as a ferret,
but they grow and mature just like any living thing. An ancient mage's spells
are often as crafty and subtle as their caster, though a spell's mind and goals
are still alien.

A wizard's spellbook is a prison or a menagerie. Spells are locked inside, ready
to be taken out and loaded into the wizard's brain. A well-trained brain is a
mind-gun, loaded each morning with spell-bullets. Minor spells, called cantrips,
infest the wizard's soul and bind to it. You can imagine them as extra, mutated
limbs, except stuck to the soul and not the body. Spells can be bred and
trained.

Wizards train in self-delusion, meditation, and other esoteric techniques to
modify their own minds to make them more accommodating to spells, and to tap
into the raw magic that suffuses the world. A wizard's mind is a dangerous
place. For every 10 students who enter the grand College of Elderstone, only 3
emerge alive and sane.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It takes 1hr to move any number of spells between your brain and a scroll,
spellbook, or wand.

To cast a spell, select a number of Magic Dice (MD) you wish to invest, roll
them, and add the numbers together. As a wizard, you get 1 MD per Wizard
template. Most spells depend on the number of [dice] invested and the [sum] they
show. If you roll doubles, see the Mishap section. If you roll triples, see the
Doom section.

Dice that roll 1-3 return to your casting pool and can be used again that
day. Dice that roll 4-6 are removed from your casting pool for the day. Your
spells return at sunrise to last location they were imprisoned, when the
octarine light of the sun touches the world and infuses Creation with an extra
boost of raw magic. Your MD return if you get a good night's sleep. If you
didn't sleep well, you can Save for each MD to have them return to your pool
anyway.

### Spellbooks

A solid volume, with thick vellum pages and a sturdy cover. Each school produces
its own style. Inside, special runes and symbols trap spells inside cages of
crystallized thought. Each book contains 10 spell slots. Some spells must be
stored across several pages for safety, so the books contain more than 10 pages,
and have plenty of room for notes, ledgers, or sketches. Spellbooks start in a
waterproof, acid- and fire-resistant bag. Outside the bag, they are not
waterproof. They are flammable. And they are also valuable - each book is worth
10gp even if it contains no spells.

### Scrolls

A page from a spellbook, effectively, but with some extra magic built in. If you
cast a spell from a scroll, you can choose to burn the scroll. If you do, add +1
MD to your roll. This MD does not return to your pool. You can generate Mishaps
and Dooms while using a scroll. A blank scroll is worth 1gp.

### Wands

Wands are like scrolls, but customized for quick use, concealment, and rapid
reuse. A wand has a number of banked MD. You can spend these MD when you cast a
spell from a wand, but you can't add in your own MD. These MD do not return to
your pool (or the wand's pool). It takes the standard 1hr to load a spell from
your brain or spellbook into a wand. Using a wand can generate Mishaps and
Dooms.

You can choose, when you move a spell, to try to invest 1 MD into the wand. You
can only do this once per day, and you take d6 damage from the strain. The MD
invested in the wand is permanently added to the wand's MD bank. Each day, you
can add another MD to the bank, as above. Banking a MD reduces your total for
the day, but you regain the full number of MD with a good night's sleep.

Most wands can only accept 4 banked MD and 1 spell. Larger wands, called staves,
can hold up to 6 banked MD and up to 3 spells. Wands are traditionally made from
the wood of lightning-struck trees.

Non-spellcasters can use wands. If they suffer a Mishap, use the table from the
school that prepared the wand. If they suffer a Doom, the automatically suffer
the Third Doom from the wand's school, which usually means instant death.

### Identifying Magic

Wizards can smell magic in the air. By tasting, rubbing, or closely inspecting
an item, you can tell if it is magic. You may need to test the item to determine
what type of magic. You can test Talent to see if you can learn anything else
about the item without testing it.

Fey, even if they aren't spellcasters, can *see* magic and magical items, though
they'll still need a professional opinion to tell what it does.

### Mishaps

If you roll doubles while casting a spell, roll on your school's Mishap
table. Unless otherwise specified, the spell still works. Magic is dangerous;
this was just a hiccough or misfire.

### Dooms

If you roll triples while casting a spell, one of your school's Dooms takes
effect. Each school has 3 Dooms. The third Doom is invariably fatal or
worse. All wizards walk a dangerous path. The burn their souls like candles,
and in doing so, court damnation.

If you complete the quest mentioned at the bottom of your school's list of
Dooms, which the GM is advised to make very difficult even for high-level
players, you are free from Dooms from that school forever. Whenever you would
take a Doom, instead roll on the Mishap table twice and take the higher roll.

## Advancing in level

   1  |       0
   2  |    2000
   3  |    4000

Coin             | 1 CP | 1 SP | 1 EP | 1 GP | 1 PP
-----------------|------|------|------|------|------
Copper Cupreks   |  1   |  10  |  50  | 100  | 1000
Silver Smoldreks | 1/10 |   1  |   5  |  10  |  100
Electrum Eltreks | 1/50 | 1/5  |   1  |   2  |   20
Gold Gildreks    | 1/100| 1/10 | 1/2  |   1  |   10
Platinum Platreks|1/1000| 1/100| 1/20 | 1/10 |    1

The best way to advance and attain higher levels is to bring treasure to
safety - your lair, safehouse, or stronghold. Each 1sp of treasure you loot and
take to safety grants you a single experience point. However, this only works if
you obtain the treasure through adventurous means! So taxes from your lordly
holdings, ransoms from characters you didn't vanquish in battle, earnings from
trade (including items created by magical spells such as *Woman's Work*) or
wages from "honest work" such as woodcutting, farming, or mining do not count
towards your next experience level.

You also get 1 XP for each 1sp you spend on non-adventuring items. For example,
buying a round of drinks for the locals (a good way to make friends, for sure)
or upgrading your safehouse. This means that spending your treasure straight
away, rather than hoarding it, could potentially double the amount of experience
you get from an adventure!

An obvious omission is combat experience from killing monsters. This is
intentional. In the GLOG, you're expected to treat combat as risky and hostile
monsters as a serious threat. Remember that many monsters are intelligent, and
if you speak their language, you may be able to reason or bargain with them...

For spells and other effects that affect hit dice (HD), players are treated as
having HD equal to their level, up to a maximum of 4.

Beyond level 4, you don't gain new abilities merely by levelling up; you must
quest for them. This includes new spells for spellcasters, new fighting styles
for fighting-men, etc.
